the nitration of benzene this page gives you the facts and a simple, uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic substitution reaction between benzene and a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid. if you want the nitration mechanism explained to you in detail, there is a link at the bottom of the page. the facts benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid at a temperature not exceeding 50c. as temperature increases there is a greater chance of getting more than one nitro group, -no2, substituted onto the ring. nitrobenzene is formed. or the concentrated sulphuric acid is acting as a catalyst. the formation of the electrophile the electrophile is the nitronium ion or the nitryl cation, no2. this is formed by reaction between the nitric acid and the sulphuric acid. the electrophilic substitution mechanism stage one stage two
