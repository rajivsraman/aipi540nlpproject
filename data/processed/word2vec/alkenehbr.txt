hydrogen bromide and alkene the peroxide effect this page give you the fact and simple uncluttered mechanism for the free radical addition of hydrogen bromide to alkene often known a the peroxide effect
if you want the mechanism explained to you in more detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
addition to symmetrical alkene a symmetrical alkene is one like ethene where the group at both end of the double bond are the same
the fact the reaction happens at room temperature in the presence of organic peroxide or some oxygen from the air
alkene react very slowly with oxygen to produce trace of organic peroxide so the two possible condition are equivalent to each other
the reaction is a simple addition of the hydrogen bromide
for example with ethene with a symmetrical alkene you get exactly the same product in the absence of the organic peroxide or oxygen but the mechanism is different
the mechanism hydrogen halide hydrogen chloride hydrogen bromide and the rest usually react with alkene using an electrophilic addition mechanism
however in the presence of organic peroxide hydrogen bromide add by a different mechanism

with the organic peroxide present you get a free radical chain reaction
chain initiation the chain is initiated by free radical produced by an bond in the organic peroxide breaking
these free radical extract a hydrogen atom from a hydrogen bromide molecule to produce bromine radical
chain propagation a bromine radical join to the ethene using one of the electron in the pi bond
that creates a new radical with the single electron on the other carbon atom
that radical reacts with another hbr molecule to produce bromoethane and another bromine radical to continue the process
etc chain termination eventually two free radical hit each other and produce a molecule of some sort
the process stop here because no new free radical are formed
addition to unsymmetrical alkene an unsymmetrical alkene is one like propene where the group at either end of the double bond are different
the fact the reaction happens under the same condition a with a symmetrical alkene but there is a complication because the hydrogen and the bromine can add in two different way
which way they add depends on whether there are organic peroxide or oxygen present or not
normally when a molecule hx add to a double bond the hydrogen becomes attached to the carbon with the more hydrogen on already
this is known a markovnikov rule
because the hbr add on the wrong way around in the presence of organic peroxide this is often known a the peroxide effect or addition
in the absence of peroxide hydrogen bromide add to propene via an electrophilic addition mechanism
that give the product predicted by markovnikov rule
the free radical mechanism chain initiation this is exactly the same a in the ethene case above
chain propagation when the bromine radical join to the propene it attache so that a secondary radical is formed
this is more stable and so easier to form than the primary radical which would be formed if it attached to the other carbon atom
that radical reacts with another hbr molecule to produce and another bromine radical to continue the process
etc chain termination eventually two free radical hit each other and produce a molecule of some sort
the process stop here because no new free radical are formed
why do the other hydrogen halide behave in the same way
the reason that hydrogen bromide add in an fashion in the presence of organic peroxide is simply a question of reaction rate
the free radical mechanism is much faster than the alternative electrophilic addition mechanism
both mechanism happen but most of the product is the one from the free radical mechanism because that is working faster
with the other hydrogen halide the opposite is true
hydrogen fluoride the bond is so strong that fluorine radical are formed in the initiation step
hydrogen chloride with hydrogen chloride the second half of the propagation stage is very slow
if you do a bond enthalpy sum you will find that the following reaction is endothermic
this is due to the relatively high bond strength
hydrogen iodide in this case the first step of the propagation stage turn out to be endothermic and this slows the reaction down
not enough energy is released when the weak bond is formed
in the case of hydrogen bromide both step of the propagation stage are exothermic
that radical reacts with another hbr molecule to produce and another bromine radical to continue the process
