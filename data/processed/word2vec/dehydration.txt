the dehydration of alcohol this page a simple duplicate of a page in the section on alkene
look at the dehydration of alcohol in the lab to make alkene for example dehydrating ethanol to make ethene
dehydration of alcohol using aluminium oxide a catalyst the dehydration of ethanol to give ethene this is a simple way of making gaseous alkene like ethene
if ethanol vapour is passed over heated aluminium oxide powder the ethanol is essentially cracked to give ethene and water vapour
to make a few test tube of ethene you can use this apparatus it would be too difficult to imagine scaling this up by boiling some ethanol in a flask and passing the vapour over aluminium oxide heated in a long tube
dehydration of alcohol using an acid catalyst the acid catalyst normally used are either concentrated sulphuric acid or concentrated phosphoric v acid h3po4
concentrated sulphuric acid produce messy result
not only is it an acid but it is also a strong oxidising agent
it oxidises some of the alcohol to carbon dioxide and at the same time is reduced itself to sulphur dioxide
both of these gas have to be removed from the alkene
it also reacts with the alcohol to produce a mass of carbon
there are other side reaction a well but these are required by any current uk a level or equivalent syllabus
the dehydration of ethanol to give ethene ethanol is heated with an excess of concentrated sulphuric acid at a temperature of
the gas produced are passed through sodium hydroxide solution to remove the carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide produced from side reaction
the ethene is collected over water
warning
this is potentially an extremely dangerous preparation because of the close proximity of the very hot concentrated sulphuric acid and the sodium hydroxide solution
i knew of one chemistry teacher who put several student into hospital by getting it wrong
that wa many year ago before safety wa taken quite so seriously a it is now
the concentrated sulphuric acid is a catalyst
write it over the arrow rather than in the equation
the dehydration of cyclohexanol to give cyclohexene this is a preparation commonly used at this level to illustrate the formation and purification of a liquid product
the fact that the carbon atom happen to be joined in a ring make no difference whatever to the chemistry of the reaction
cyclohexanol is heated with concentrated phosphoric v acid and the liquid cyclohexene distils off and can be collected and purified
phosphoric v acid tends to be used in place of sulphuric acid because it is safer and produce a less messy reaction
phosphoric v acid is a strong oxidising agent
the dehydration of more complicated alcohol you have to be wary with more complicated alcohol in case there is the possibility of more than one alkene being formed
is a good example of this with no less than three different alkene being formed when it is dehydrated
is just an example to illustrate the problem
it is important that you understand it so that you can work out what will happen in similar case
it would be quite impossible for you to learn what happens with every single alcohol you might be presented with
when you dehydrate an alcohol you remove the group and a hydrogen atom from the next carbon atom in the chain
with molecule like there are two possibility when that happens
that lead to these product the product are and
in fact the situation is even more complicated than it look because exhibit geometric isomerism
you get a mixture of two isomer formed and
is also known a z is also known a e
for an explanation of the two way of naming these two compound follow the link in the box below
which isomer get formed is just a matter of chance
geometric isomerism isomerism is where you can draw more than one arrangement of the atom for a given molecular formula
geometric isomerism is a special case of this involving molecule which have restricted rotation around one of the bond in this case a double bond
the bond could only rotate if enough energy is put in to break the pi bond
effectively except at high temperature the bond is locked
in the case of the two ch3 group will either both be locked on one side of the to give the ci or z isomer or on opposite side to give the trans or e one

beware
it is easy to miss geometric isomer in an exam
always draw alkene with the correct bond angle around the bond a shown in the diagram for the ci and trans isomer above
if you take a short cut and write a you will almost certainly miss the fact that ci and trans form are possible
this is a rich source of question in an exam
you could easily throw away mark if you miss these possibility
the overall result dehydration of lead to a mixture containing also known a z also known a e
