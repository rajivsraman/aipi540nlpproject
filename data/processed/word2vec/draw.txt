drawing organic molecule this page explains the various way that organic molecule can be represented on paper or on screen including molecular formula and various form of structural formula
molecular formula a molecular formula simply count the number of each sort of atom present in the molecule but tell you nothing about the way they are joined together
for example the molecular formula of butane is c4h10 and the molecular formula of ethanol is c2h6o
molecular formula are very rarely used in organic chemistry because they do give any useful information about the bonding in the molecule
about the only place where you might come across them is in equation for the combustion of simple hydrocarbon for example in case like this the bonding in the organic molecule is important
structural formula a structural formula show how the various atom are bonded
there are various way of drawing this and you will need to be familiar with all of them
displayed formula a displayed formula show all the bond in the molecule a individual line
you need to remember that each line represents a pair of shared electron
for example this is a model of methane together with it displayed formula notice that the way the methane is drawn bear no resemblance to the actual shape of the molecule
methane is flat with bond angle
this mismatch between what you draw and what the molecule actually look like can lead to problem if you are careful
for example consider the simple molecule with the molecular formula ch2cl2
you might think that there were two different way of arranging these atom if you drew a displayed formula
the chlorine could be opposite each other or at right angle to each other
but these two structure are actually exactly the same
look at how they appear a model
one structure is in reality a simple rotation of the other one
if your school or college ha given you the opportunity to play around with molecular model in the early stage of your organic chemistry course you might consider getting hold of a cheap set
the model made by molymod are both cheap and easy to use
an introductory organic set is more than adequate
google molymod to find a supplier and more about them or search for molymod on amazon
share the cost with some friend keep it in good condition and do lose any bit and resell it via ebay or amazon at the end of your course
alternatively get hold of some coloured plasticene or other child modelling clay and some used match and make your own
it cheaper but more difficult to get the bond angle right
consider a slightly more complicated molecule c2h5cl
the displayed formula could be written a either of these but again these are exactly the same
look at the model
the commonest way to draw structural formula for anything other than the most simple molecule drawing a fully displayed formula is a bit of a bother especially all the bond
you can simplify the formula by writing for example ch3 or ch2 instead of showing all these bond
so for example ethanoic acid would be shown in a fully displayed form and a simplified form a you could even condense it further to ch3cooh and would probably do this if you had to write a simple chemical equation involving ethanoic acid
you do however lose something by condensing the acid group in this way because you ca immediately see how the bonding work
you still have to be careful in drawing structure in this way
remember from above that these two structure both represent the same molecule the next three structure all represent butane
all of these are just version of four carbon atom joined up in a line
the only difference is that there ha been some rotation about some of the bond
you can see this in a couple of model
not one of the structural formula accurately represents the shape of butane
the convention is that we draw it with all the carbon atom in a straight line a in the first of the structure above
this is even more important when you start to have branched chain of carbon atom
the following structure again all represent the same molecule
the two structure on the left are fairly obviously the same all we done is flip the molecule over
the other one is so obvious until you look at the structure in detail
there are four carbon joined up in a row with a ch3 group attached to the one
that exactly the same a the other two structure
if you had a model the only difference between these three diagram is that you have rotated some of the bond and turned the model around a bit
to overcome this possible confusion the convention is that you always look for the longest possible chain of carbon atom and then draw it horizontally
anything else is simply hung off that chain
it doe matter in the least whether you draw any side group pointing up or down
all of the following represent exactly the same molecule
if you made a model of one of them you could turn it into any other one simply by rotating one or more of the bond
how to draw structural formula in there are occasion when it is important to be able to show the precise arrangement in part of some molecule
to do this the bond are shown using conventional symbol for example you might want to show the arrangement of the group around the carbon which ha the group in
ha the structural formula using conventional bond notation you could draw it a for example the only difference between these is a slight rotation of the bond between the centre two carbon atom
this is shown in the two model below
look carefully at them particularly at what ha happened to the lone hydrogen atom
in the model it is tucked behind the carbon atom
in the model it is in the same plane
the change is very slight
it doe matter in the least which of the two arrangement you draw
you could easily invent other one a well
choose one of them and get into the habit of drawing structure that way
my own habit used elsewhere on this site is to draw two bond going back into the paper and one coming out a in the diagram above
notice that no attempt wa made to show the whole molecule in in the structural formula diagram
the ch2ch3 group wa left in a simple form
keep diagram simple trying to show too much detail make the whole thing amazingly difficult to understand
skeletal formula in a skeletal formula all the hydrogen atom are removed from carbon chain leaving just a carbon skeleton with functional group attached to it
for example we just been talking about
the normal structural formula and the skeletal formula look like this in a skeletal diagram of this sort there is a carbon atom at each junction between bond in a chain and at the end of each bond unless there is something else there already like the group in the example there are enough hydrogen atom attached to each carbon to make the total number of bond on that carbon up to 4
beware
diagram of this sort take practice to interpret correctly and may well not be acceptable to your examiner see below
there are however some very common case where they are frequently used
these case involve ring of carbon atom which are surprisingly awkward to draw tidily in a normal structural formula
cyclohexane c6h12 is a ring of carbon atom each with two hydrogen attached
this is what it look like in both a structural formula and a skeletal formula
and this is cyclohexene which is similar but contains a double bond but the commonest of all is the benzene ring c6h6 which ha a special symbol of it own
so for example ethanoic acid would be shown in a fully displayed form and a simplified form a you could even condense it further to ch3cooh and would probably do this if you had to write a simple chemical equation involving ethanoic acid

it is explained in full in two page on the structure of benzene elsewhere in this site
it would probably be better not to follow this link unless you are actively interested in benzene chemistry at the moment it will lead you off into quite deep water
deciding which sort of formula to use there no easy answer to this problem
it depends more than anything else on experience a feeling that a particular way of writing a formula is best for the situation you are dealing with
do worry about this a you do more and more organic chemistry you will probably find it will come naturally
you get so used to writing formula in reaction mechanism or for the structure for isomer or in simple chemical equation that you wo even think about it
there are however a few guideline that you should follow
what doe your syllabus say
different examiner will have different preference
check first with your syllabus
if you a copy of your syllabus from your examiner web site it is easy to check what they say they want
use the find function on your adobe acrobat reader to search the organic section s of the syllabus for the word formula
you should also check recent exam paper and particulary mark scheme to find out what sort of formula the examiner really prefer in given situation
you could also look at any support material published by your examiner

what if you still are sure
draw the most detailed formula that you can fit into the space available
if in doubt draw a fully displayed formula
you would never lose mark for giving too much detail
apart from the most trivial case for example burning hydrocarbon never use a molecular formula
always show the detail around the important part s of a molecule
for example the important part of an ethene molecule is the double bond so write at the very least and not c2h4
where a particular way of drawing a structure is important this will always be pointed out where it arises elsewhere on this site
