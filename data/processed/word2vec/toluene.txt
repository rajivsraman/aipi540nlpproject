electrophilic substitution into already substituted benzene ring this page discusses the problem which arise if you try to write the mechanism for an electrophilic substitution reaction into a benzene ring which already ha something else attached to it
there are two problem you might come across whereabouts in the ring doe the substitution happen
doe this make a difference to how you draw the mechanism
important
this page assumes that you can already write the mechanism for substitution into a simple benzene ring
if you ca go back to the electrophilic substitution menu and read about the reaction you are interested in before you tackle this page
the nitration of methylbenzene if you substitute a nitro group into the benzene ring in methylbenzene you could possibly get any of the following product the carbon with the methyl group attached is thought of a the number 1 carbon and the ring is then numbered around from 1 to 6
you number in a direction in this case clockwise which produce the smaller number in the name hence rather than
in the case of methylbenzene whatever you attach to the ring you always get a mixture consisting mainly of the and isomer
the methyl group is said to be in the sense that it seems to push incoming group into those position
isomer molecule which have the same molecular formula
contain exactly the same number and type of atom but with a different spatial arrangement of those atom
some other group which might already be on the ring for example the group in nitrobenzene push incoming group into the position
we have a quick look at this later on this page
what to expect in exam at a level you will not be expected to explain why different group have different directing effect
it is possible however that you may be expected to remember the directing effect of one or two group
it is very difficult to tell this from the syllabus most of which do specifically exclude the possibility but that could simply be an oversight
your best option is to check past exam paper or any support material published by your exam board
if in doubt contact them and find out exactly what they expect
exam board on the syllabus page
in an exam then you may have to remember the directing effect of a particular group or more likely you will be told it
your problem may then be to write the mechanism
how to write the mechanism for the nitration of methylbenzene important
this assumes that you are already familiar with the nitration of benzene
if you are read about it before you go any further
reacting methylbenzene with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acid give both and
the mechanism is exactly the same a the nitration of benzene
you just have to be careful about the way that you draw the structure of the intermediate ion
making the first step this just show the first step of the electrophilic substitution reaction
notice that the partial delocalisation in the intermediate ion cover all the carbon atom in the ring except for the one that the group get attached to
that is the only point of interest in this example everything else is just the same a with the nitration of benzene
the hydrogen atom is then removed by an ion exactly a in the benzene case
making the first step once again the only point of interest is in the way the partial delocalisation in the intermediate ion is drawn again it cover all the carbon atom in the ring apart from the one with the group attached
the electrophilic substitution reaction between methylbenzene and chlorine this is a good example of a case where what is already attached to the ring can also get involved in the reaction
it is possible to get two quite different substitution reaction between methylbenzene and chlorine depending on the condition used
the chlorine can substitute into the ring or into the methyl group
here we are only interested in substitution into the ring
this happens in the presence of aluminium chloride or iron and in the absence of uv light
uv light and with no catalyst present you will find this explained in the page on the free radical reaction between methylbenzene and chlorine
substituting into the ring give a mixture of and
the mechanism are exactly the same a the substitution of chlorine into benzene although you would have to be careful about the way you draw the intermediate ion
important
this assumes that you are already familiar with the chlorination of benzene
if you are read about it before you go any further
for example the complete mechanism for substitution into the position is stage one stage two substitution into the position the first step methyl group direct new group into the and position but a nitro group already on the ring directs incoming group into the position
for example if the temperature is raised above the nitation of benzene doe just produce nitrobenzene it also produce some
a second nitro group is substituted into the ring in the position
the mechanism is exactly the same a the nitration of benzene or of methylbenzene you just have to be careful in drawing the intermediate ion
draw the partial delocalisation to include all the carbon except for the one the new group get attached to
in the second stage the hydrogen atom is then removed by an ion exactly a in the benzene case
this is shown because there nothing new
