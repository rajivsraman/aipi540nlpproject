amine and nitrous acid this page look at the reaction of nitrous acid with aliphatic amine those where the amine group is attached directly to a benzene ring
nitrous acid is properly called nitric iii acid but that name is commonly used
reaction between nitrous acid and aromatic amine like phenylamine where the group is attached directly to a benzene ring are dealt with elsewhere
testing for the various type of amine background the reaction between amine and nitrous acid wa used in the past a a very neat way of distinguishing between primary secondary and tertiary amine
however the product with a secondary amine is a powerful carcinogen and so this reaction is no longer carried out at this level
nitrous acid hno2 sometimes written a hono to show it structure is unstable and is always prepared in situ
it is usually made by reacting a solution containing sodium or potassium nitrite sodium or potassium nitrate iii with hydrochloric acid
nitrous acid is a weak acid and so you get the reaction because nitrous acid is a weak acid the position of equilibrium lie well the right
in each of the following reaction the amine would be acidified with hydrochloric acid and a solution of sodium or potassium nitrite added
the acid and the nitrite form nitrous acid which then reacts with the amine
primary amine and nitrous acid the main observation is a burst of colourless odourless gas
nitrogen is given off
unfortunately there is no single equation that you can quote for this
you get lot of different organic product
for example amongst the product you get an alcohol where the group ha been replaced by oh
if you want a single equation you could quote taking a an example
but the will be only one product among many including propene and others
the nitrogen however is given off in quantity exactly a suggested by the equation
by measuring the amount of nitrogen produced you could use this reaction to work out the amount of amine present in the solution
in the first instance you get a diazonium ion formed for example
unless the group is attached directly to a benzene ring these ion are very unstable and fall apart immediately to give nitrogen gas and a carbocation carbonium ion in this example
it is rearrangement and reaction of this ion which lead to the mess of product
with aromatic amine like phenylamine aniline the diazonium ion formed is much more stable
if you are interested in reaction of diazonium ion but only in the context of amine like phenylamine follow this link

secondary amine and nitrous acid this time there is any gas produced
instead you get a yellow oil called a nitrosamine
these compound are powerful carcinogen avoid them
for example tertiary amine and nitrous acid again a quite different result
this time nothing visually interesting happens you are left with a colourless solution
all that ha happened is that the amine ha formed an ion by reacting with the acid present
with trimethylamine for example you would get a trimethylammonium ion ch3
this is actually a bit misleading
the solution will contain trimethylammonium ion and nitrite ion and also chloride ion from the hydrochloric acid
there is any reason why the trimethylammonium ion should be thought of a combining with the nitrite ion in some way rather than with the chloride ion
they are all just ion milling around in the solution
