electronegativity this page deal with electronegativity in an organic chemistry context
if you want a wider view of electronegativity there is a link at the bottom of the page
what is electronegativity
electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electron
the pauling scale is the most commonly used
fluorine the most electronegative element is given a value of and value range down to caesium and francium which are the least electronegative at
what happens if two atom of equal electronegativity bond together
the most obvious example of this is the bond between two carbon atom
both atom will attract the bonding pair to exactly the same extent
that mean that on average the electron pair will be found half way between the two nucleus and you could draw a picture of the bond like this it is important to realise that this is an average picture
the electron are actually in a sigma orbital and are moving constantly within that orbital
help
a sigma orbital is a molecular orbital formed by overlap between two atomic orbitals

the bond fluorine is much more electronegative than carbon
the actual value on the pauling scale are that mean that fluorine attracts the bonding pair much more strongly than carbon doe
the bond on average will look like this why is fluorine more electronegative than carbon
a simple diagram of a bond is perfectly adequate to explain it
the bonding pair is in the second energy level of both carbon and fluorine so in the absence of any other effect the distance of the pair from both nucleus would be the same
the electron pair is shielded from the full force of both nucleus by the 1 electron again there is nothing to pull it closer to one atom than the other
but the fluorine nucleus ha 9 proton whereas the carbon nucleus ha only 6
allowing for the shielding effect of the 1 electron the bonding pair feel a net pull of about from the carbon but about from the fluorine
it is this extra nuclear charge which pull the bonding pair on average closer to the fluorine than the carbon
help
you have to imagine what the bonding pair see if it look in towards the nucleus
in the carbon case it see 6 positive proton and 2 negative electron
that mean that there will be a net pull from the carbon of about
the shielding would actually be quite a high a because the 1 electron spend some of their time on the far side of the carbon nucleus and so are always between the bonding pair and the nucleus
incidentally thinking about electron looking towards the nucleus may be helpful in picturing what is going on but avoid using term like this in exam
the bond the electronegativity are the bonding pair of electron will be dragged towards the chlorine but not a much a in the fluorine case
chlorine is a electronegative a fluorine
why is chlorine a electronegative a fluorine
chlorine is a bigger atom than fluorine
fluorine 1s22s22px22py22pz1 chlorine 1s22s22px22py22pz23s23px23py23pz1 help

in the chlorine case the bonding pair will be shielded by all the and electron
the 17 proton on the nucleus will be shielded by a total of 10 electron giving a net pull from the chlorine of about
that is the same a the pull from the fluorine but with chlorine the bonding pair start off further away from the nucleus because it is in the
since it is further away it feel the pull from the nucleus less strongly
bond polarity and inductive effect polar bond think about the bond again
because the bonding pair is pulled towards the fluorine end of the bond that end is left rather more negative than it would otherwise be
the carbon end is left rather short of electron and so becomes slightly positive
the symbol and mean slightly positive and slightly negative
you read a delta plus or delta positive
we describe a bond having one end slightly positive and the other end slightly negative a being polar
inductive effect an atom like fluorine which can pull the bonding pair away from the atom it is attached to is said to have a negative inductive effect
most atom that you will come across have a negative inductive effect when they are attached to a carbon atom because they are mostly more electronegative than carbon
you will come across some group of atom which have a slight positive inductive effect they push electron towards the carbon they are attached to making it slightly negative
inductive effect are sometimes given symbol a negative inductive effect and a positive inductive effect
provided that you understand what happens when electronegative atom like fluorine or chlorine are attached to carbon atom in term of the polarity of the bond that really all you need for most purpose
some important example of polar bond hydrogen bromide and other hydrogen halide bromine and the other halogen are all more electronegative than hydrogen and so all the hydrogen halide have polar bond with the hydrogen end slightly positive and the halogen end slightly negative
help
halogen a member of group vii of the periodic table fluorine chlorine bromine and iodine
halide a compound of one of these
hydrogen chloride hydrogen bromide etc
the polarity of these molecule is important in their reaction with alkene
the bond in halogenoalkanes bromine is more electronegative than carbon and so the bond is polarised in the way that we have already described with and
the polarity of the bond is important in the reaction of the halogenoalkanes
the double bond an orbital model of the bond in methanal hcho look like this the very electronegative oxygen atom pull both bonding pair towards itself in the sigma bond and the pi bond
that leaf the oxygen fairly negative and the carbon fairly positive
