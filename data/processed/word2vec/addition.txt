simple addition to aldehyde and ketone this page look at the addition of hydrogen cyanide and sodium hydrogensulphite sodium bisulphite to aldehyde and ketone
addition of hydrogen cyanide to aldehyde and ketone the reaction hydrogen cyanide add across the double bond in aldehyde and ketone to produce compound known a hydroxynitriles
these used to be known a cyanohydrin
for example with ethanal an aldehyde you get with propanone a ketone you get the carbon with the nitrogen attached is always counted a the number 1 carbon in the chain
the reaction is normally done using hydrogen cyanide itself because this is an extremely poisonous gas
instead the aldehyde or ketone is mixed with a solution of sodium or potassium cyanide in water to which a little sulphuric acid ha been added
the ph of the solution is adjusted to about 4 5 because this give the fastest reaction
the reaction happens at room temperature
the solution will contain hydrogen cyanide from the reaction between the sodium or potassium cyanide and the sulphuric acid but still contains some free cyanide ion
this is important for the mechanism
us of the reaction the product molecule contain two functional group the group which behaves like a simple alcohol and can be replaced by other thing like chlorine which can in turn be replaced to give for example an group the group which is easily converted into a carboxylic acid group
for example starting from a hydroxynitrile made from an aldehyde you can quite easily produce relatively complicated molecule like acid the amino acid which are used to construct protein
the second step is the reaction between a halogenoalkane and ammonia
the final step is hydrolysis of a nitrile

addition of sodium hydrogensulphite to aldehyde and ketone sodium hydrogensulphite used to be known a sodium bisulphite and you might well still come across it in organic textbook under this name or using the bisulfite spelling
uk a level student you probably wo need this reaction
check your syllabus before you bother to read on

the reaction this reaction only work well for aldehyde
in the case of ketone one of the hydrocarbon group attached to the carbonyl group need to be a methyl group
bulky group attached to the carbonyl group get in the way of the reaction happening
the aldehyde or ketone is shaken with a saturated solution of sodium hydrogensulphite in water
where the product is formed it separate a white crystal
if you start with aqueous solution of methanal or ethanal there may be enough water present that the product doe actually form crystal
in the case of ethanal the equation is
and with propanone the equation is these compound are rarely named systematically and are usually known a hydrogensulphite or bisulphite addition compound
us of the reaction the reaction is usually used during the purification of aldehyde and any ketone that it work for
the addition compound can be split easily to regenerate the aldehyde or ketone by treating it with either dilute acid or dilute alkali
if you have an impure aldehyde for example you could shake it with a saturated solution of sodium hydrogensulphite to produce the crystal
these crystal could easily be filtered and washed to remove any other impurity
addition of dilute acid for example would then regenerate the original aldehyde
it would of course still need to be separated from the excess acid and assorted inorganic product of the reaction but that is beyond the scope of this page
