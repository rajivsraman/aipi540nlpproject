bonding in carbonyl compound important
do try to read this unless you are sure that you fully understand the orbital view of the bonding in methane and the bonding in ethene
you may also find it useful to read the article on orbitals if you are sure about simple orbital theory
the carbonyl group the simple view of the bonding in carbon oxygen double bond where the double bond occurs in organic compound it is called a carbonyl group
the simplest compound containing this group is methanal
we are going to look at the bonding in methanal but it would equally apply to any other compound containing
the interesting thing is the nature of the double bond not what it attached to
hcho
if you wrote it a hcoh it look a if it contains an group and it doe
methanal is an aldehyde
all aldehyde contain the cho group
naming methanal meth count 1 carbon atom an mean no al say that it is an aldehyde and so contains cho
an orbital view of the bonding in carbon oxygen double bond the carbon atom just a in ethene or benzene the carbon atom is joined to three other atom
the carbon electron rearrange themselves and promotion and hybridisation give sp2 hybrid orbitals
promotion give hybridisation of the 2 orbital and two of the 2p orbitals mean that the carbon atom now look like the diagram on the right
three sp2 hybrid orbitals are formed and these arrange themselves a far apart in space a they can at to each other
the remaining p orbital is at right angle to them
this is exactly the same a in ethene or in benzene
important
if this is really clear to you you must go and read the article about the bonding in ethene
the oxygen atom oxygen electronic structure is 1s22s22px22py12pz1
the 1 electron are too deep inside the atom to be concerned with the bonding and so we ignore them from now on
hybridisation occurs in the oxygen a well
it is easier to see this using
this time two of the sp2 hybrid orbitals contain lone pair of electron
help
a lone pair of electron is a pair of electron at the bonding level which is being used to bond on to another atom
the carbon atom and oxygen atom then bond in much the same way a the two carbon do in ethene
in the next diagram we are assuming that the carbon will also bond to two hydrogen to make methanal but it could equally well bond to anything else
overlap between the atomic orbitals that are pointing towards each other produce sigma bond
notice that the p orbitals are overlapping sideways
this sideways overlap produce a pi bond
so just like is made up of a sigma bond and a pi bond
doe that mean that the bonding is exactly the same a in ethene
no
the distribution of electron in the pi bond is heavily distorted towards the oxygen end of the bond because oxygen is much more electronegative than carbon
help
you can read about the origin of electronegativity and it effect in organic compound in a separate article
this distortion in the pi bond cause major difference in the reaction of compound containing double bond like methanal compared with compound containing double bond like ethene
