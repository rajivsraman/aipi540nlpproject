reaction involving halogenoalkanes and silver nitrate solution this page look at how silver nitrate solution can be used a part of a test for halogenoalkanes haloalkane or alkyl halide and also a a mean of measuring their relative reactivity
testing for halogenoalkanes silver nitrate solution can be used to find out which halogen is present in a suspected halogenoalkane
the most effective way is to do a substitution reaction which turn the halogen into a halide ion and then to test for that ion with silver nitrate solution
doing the reaction the halogenoalkane is warmed with some sodium hydroxide solution in a mixture of ethanol and water
everything will dissolve in this mixture and so you can get a good reaction
the halogen atom is displaced a a halide ion there is no need to make this reaction go to completion
the silver nitrate test is sensitive enough to detect fairly small concentration of halide ion
the mixture is acidified by adding dilute nitric acid
this prevents unreacted hydroxide ion reacting with the silver ion to give a confusing precipitate
then silver nitrate solution is added
various precipitate may be formed from the reaction between the silver and halide ion confirming the precipitate it is actually quite difficult to distinguish between these colour especially if there is much precipitate
you can sort out which precipitate you have by adding ammonia solution
comparing halogenoalkane reactivity background in this case various halogenoalkanes are treated with a solution of silver nitrate in a mixture of ethanol and water
nothing else is added
after varying length of time precipitate appear a halide ion produced from reaction of the halogenoalkanes react with the silver ion present
a long a you are doing everything under controlled condition same amount of everything same temperature and so on the time taken give a good guide to the reactivity of the halogenoalkanes the quicker the precipitate appears the more reactive the halogenoalkane
the halide ion is formed in one of two way depending on the type of halogenoalkane you have present primary secondary or tertiary
for a primary halogenoalkane the main reaction is one between the halogenoalkane and water in the solvent
a tertiary halogenoalkane ionises to a very small extent of it own accord
secondary halogenoalkanes do a bit of both of these
comparing the reaction rate a you change the halogen you would have to keep the type of halogenoalkane primary secondary or tertiary constant but vary the halogen
you might for example compare the time taken to produce a precipitate from this series of primary halogenoalkanes obviously the time taken for a precipitate of silver halide to appear will depend on how much of everything you use and the temperature at which the reaction is carried out
but the pattern of result is always the same
for example a primary iodo compound produce a precipitate quite quickly
a primary bromo compound take longer to give a precipitate
a primary chloro compound probably wo give any precipitate until well after you have lost interest in the whole thing
the order of reactivity reflects the strength of the bond
the bond is the weakest and the the strongest of the three bond
in order for a halide ion to be produced the bond ha to be broken
the weaker the bond the easier that is
if you have looked at the mechanism for these reaction you will know that a lone pair on a water molecule attack the slightly positive carbon atom attached to the halogen
it is slightly positive because most of the halogen are more electronegative than carbon and so pull electron away from the carbon
it is tempting to think that the reaction will be faster if the electronegativity difference is greater
the slight positive charge on the carbon will be larger if it is attached to a chlorine atom than to an iodine atom
that mean that there will be more attraction between a lone pair on the water and a carbon atom attached to a chlorine atom than if it wa attached to an iodine atom
the electronegativity difference between carbon and iodine is negligible
however the fastest reaction is with an iodoalkane
in these reaction bond strength is the main factor deciding the relative rate of reaction
comparing the reaction rate of primary secondary and tertiary halogenoalkanes you would need to keep the halogen atom constant
it is common to use bromide because they have moderate reaction rate
you could for example compare the reactivity of these compound again the actual time taken will vary with reaction condition but the pattern will always be the same
for example the tertiary halide produce a precipitate almost instantly
the secondary halide give a slight precipitate after a few second
the precipitate thickens up with time
the primary halide may take considerably longer to produce a precipitate
it is more difficult to explain the reason for this because it need a fairly intimate knowledge of the mechanism involved in the reaction
it reflects the change in the way that the halide ion is produced a you go from primary to secondary to tertiary halogenoalkanes
