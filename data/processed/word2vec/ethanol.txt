the manufacture of ethanol this page describes the manufacture of ethanol by the direct hydration of ethene and then go on to explain the reason for the condition used in the process
it look at the effect of proportion temperature pressure and catalyst on the composition of the equilibrium mixture and the rate of the reaction
important if you are sure about using le chatelier principle or about the effect of changing condition on rate of reaction you should explore these link before you go on
when you are reading this page if you find that you are understanding the effect of changing one of the condition on the position of equilibrium or on the rate of the reaction come back and follow up these link
a brief summary of the manufacture of ethanol ethanol is manufactured by reacting ethene with steam
the reaction is reversible and the formation of the ethanol is exothermic
only 5 of the ethene is converted into ethanol at each pas through the reactor
by removing the ethanol from the equilibrium mixture and recycling the ethene it is possible to achieve an overall 95 conversion
a flow scheme for the reaction look like this when the gas from the reactor are cooled then excess steam will condense a well a the ethanol
the ethanol will have to be separated from the water by fractional distillation
all the source i have looked at gloss over this so i do have any detail
i assume it is a normal fractional distillation of an mixture
explaining the condition the proportion of ethene and steam the equation show that the ethene and steam react 1 1
in order to get this ratio you would have to use equal volume of the two gas
because water is cheap it would seem sensible to use an excess of steam in order to move the position of equilibrium to the right according to le chatelier principle
in practice an excess of ethene is used
this is very surprising at first sight
even if the reaction wa you could possibly convert all the ethene into ethanol
there is enough steam to react with it
the reason for this oddity lie with the nature of the catalyst
the catalyst is phosphoric v acid coated onto a solid silicon dioxide support
if you use too much steam it dilutes the catalyst and can even wash it off the support making it useless
the temperature equilibrium consideration you need to shift the position of the equilibrium a far a possible to the right in order to produce the maximum possible amount of ethanol in the equilibrium mixture
the forward reaction the production of ethanol is exothermic
according to le chatelier principle this will be favoured if you lower the temperature
the system will respond by moving the position of equilibrium to counteract this in other word by producing more heat
in order to get a much ethanol a possible in the equilibrium mixture you need a low a temperature a possible
however is particularly low
rate consideration the lower the temperature you use the slower the reaction becomes
a manufacturer is trying to produce a much ethanol a possible per day
it make no sense to try to achieve an equilibrium mixture which contains a very high proportion of ethanol if it take several year for the reaction to reach that equilibrium
you need the gas to reach equilibrium within the very short time that they will be in contact with the catalyst in the reactor
the compromise is a compromise temperature producing an acceptable proportion of ethanol in the equilibrium mixture but in a very short time
under these condition about 5 of the ethene reacts to give ethanol at each pas over the catalyst
the pressure equilibrium consideration notice that there are 2 molecule on the side of the equation but only 1 on the right
according to le chatelier principle if you increase the pressure the system will respond by favouring the reaction which produce fewer molecule
that will cause the pressure to fall again
in order to get a much ethanol a possible in the equilibrium mixture you need a high a pressure a possible
high pressure also increase the rate of the reaction
however the pressure used is all that high
problem with high pressure there are two quite separate problem in this case high pressure are expensive
it cost more to build the original plant because you need extremely strong pipe and containment vessel
it also need a lot of energy to produce the high pressure
that can make the ethanol uneconomic to produce
at high pressure the ethene polymerises to make poly ethene
apart from wasting ethene this could also clog up the plant
the catalyst equilibrium consideration the catalyst ha no effect whatsoever on the position of the equilibrium
adding a catalyst doe produce any greater percentage of ethanol in the equilibrium mixture
it only function is to speed up the reaction
rate consideration in the absence of a catalyst the reaction is so slow that virtually no reaction happens in any sensible time
the catalyst ensures that the reaction is fast enough for a dynamic equilibrium to be set up within the very short time that the gas are actually in the reactor
