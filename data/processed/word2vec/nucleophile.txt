amine a nucleophiles this page summarises the reaction of amine a nucleophiles
this includes their reaction with halogenoalkanes haloalkane or alkyl halide with acyl chloride acid chloride and with acid anhydride
all of these reaction are dealt with in detail on other page and you will find link to all of these
you will find a link at the bottom of this page
it might be a good idea to read the current page first though
the nucleophilic property of amine why do amine act a nucleophiles
a nucleophile is something which is attracted to and then attack a positive or slightly positive part of another molecule or ion
all amine contain an active lone pair of electron on the very electronegative nitrogen atom
it is these electron which are attracted to positive part of other molecule or ion
the reaction of primary amine with halogenoalkanes you get a complicated series of reaction on heating to give a mixture of product probably one of the most confusing set of reaction you will meet at this level
the product of the reaction include secondary and tertiary amine and their salt and quaternary ammonium salt
making secondary amine and their salt in the first stage of the reaction you get the salt of a secondary amine formed
for example if you started with ethylamine and bromoethane you would get diethylammonium bromide in the presence of excess ethylamine in the mixture there is the possibility of a reversible reaction
the ethylamine remove a hydrogen from the diethylammonium ion to give free diethylamine a secondary amine
making tertiary amine and their salt but it doe stop here
the diethylamine also reacts with bromoethane in the same two stage a before
this is where the reaction would start if you reacted a secondary amine with a halogenoalkane
in the first stage you get triethylammonium bromide
there is again the possibility of a reversible reaction between this salt and excess ethylamine in the mixture
the ethylamine remove a hydrogen ion from the triethylammonium ion to leave a tertiary amine triethylamine
making a quaternary ammonium salt the final stage
the triethylamine reacts with bromoethane to give tetraethylammonium bromide a quaternary ammonium salt one in which all four hydrogen have been replaced by alkyl group
this time there is any hydrogen left on the nitrogen to be removed
the reaction stop here
it would be useful to read that in order to compare the ammonia reaction with the amine reaction
the only real difference is that the hydrogen ion are removed by an amine in the case we are currently looking at rather than ammonia on the other page
you will find a further link to the mechanism for these reaction on that page
if you follow that link it will take you to quite a number of page exploring these reaction
you will need to spend some time on these if you really want to understand this
however understanding the reaction in term of their mechanism mean that you can work out what happens if you need to rather than trying to remember all this a fairly pointless and exercise

the reaction of amine with acyl chloride acid chloride we take the reaction between methylamine and ethanoyl chloride a typical
if you add concentrated methylamine solution to ethanoyl chloride there is a violent reaction in the cold
and methylammonium chloride are formed partly a a white solid mixture and partly in solution
the overall equation is you will also find a link to the introduction to the mechanism for these reaction on that page
if you want to go straight to the mechanism for the amine reaction you could follow this link

the reaction of amine with acid anhydride these reaction are chemically similar to those between amine and acyl chloride but they are much slower needing heat
taking the reaction between methylamine and ethanoic anhydride a typical the product is a with ethanoyl chloride but this time the other product is methylammonium ethanoate rather than methylammonium chloride
methylammonium chloride is of course also ionic
i have also reversed the formula for the methylammonium ion so that the positive charge is close to the negative charge on the ethanoate ion
this reaction and the corresponding one with ammonia is discussed in detail on a page about the reaction between acid anhydride and nitrogen compound
this is quite difficult stuff it would pay you to read the whole of that page fairly carefully if you really want to understand what going on
