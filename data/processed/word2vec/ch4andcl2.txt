the reaction between methane and chlorine this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the free radical substitution reaction between methane and chlorine
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact if a mixture of methane and chlorine is exposed to a flame it explodes producing carbon and hydrogen chloride
this is a very useful reaction
the reaction we are going to explore is a more gentle one between methane and chlorine in the presence of ultraviolet light typically sunlight
this is a good example of a photochemical reaction a reaction brought about by light
it is better to use the term photochemical and keep the word catalysis for reaction speeded up by actual substance rather than light
the organic product is chloromethane
one of the hydrogen atom in the methane ha been replaced by a chlorine atom so this is a substitution reaction
however the reaction doe stop there and all the hydrogen in the methane can in turn be replaced by chlorine atom
multiple substitution is dealt with on a separate page and you will find a link to that at the bottom of this page
the mechanism the mechanism involves a chain reaction
during a chain reaction for every reactive specie you start off with a new one is generated at the end and this keep the process going
specie a useful word which is used in chemistry to mean any sort of particle you want it to mean
it cover molecule ion atom or in this case free radical
the process is known a free radical substitution or a a free radical chain reaction
what is free radical substitution

chain initiation the chain is initiated started by uv light breaking a chlorine molecule into free radical
chain propagation reaction these are the reaction which keep the chain going
chain termination reaction these are reaction which remove free radical from the system without replacing them by new one
