elimination versus substitution in halogenoalkanes this page discusses the factor that decide whether halogenoalkanes undergo elimination reaction or nucleophilic substitution when they react with hydroxide ion from say sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide
detail for each of these type of reaction are given elsewhere and you will find link to them from this page
the reaction both reaction involve heating the halogenoalkane under reflux with sodium or potassium hydroxide solution
nucleophilic substitution the hydroxide ion present are good nucleophiles and one possibility is a replacement of the halogen atom by an group to give an alcohol via a nucleophilic substitution reaction
in the example is converted into
elimination halogenoalkanes also undergo elimination reaction in the presence of sodium or potassium hydroxide
the ha reacted to give an alkene propene
notice that a hydrogen atom ha been removed from one of the end carbon atom together with the bromine from the centre one
in all simple elimination reaction the thing being removed are on adjacent carbon atom and a double bond is set up between those carbon
what decides whether you get substitution or elimination
the reagent you are using are the same for both substitution or elimination the halogenoalkane and either sodium or potassium hydroxide solution
in all case you will get a mixture of both reaction happening some substitution and some elimination
what you get most of depends on a number of factor
the type of halogenoalkane this is the most important factor
important
if you are clear about the various type of halogenoalkanes it is essential that you follow this link before you read on

for example whatever you do with tertiary halogenoalkanes you will tend to get mainly the elimination reaction whereas with primary one you will tend to get mainly substitution
however you can influence thing to some extent by changing the condition
the solvent the proportion of water to ethanol in the solvent matter
water encourages substitution
ethanol encourages elimination
the temperature higher temperature encourage elimination
concentration of the sodium or potassium hydroxide solution higher concentration favour elimination
in summary for a given halogenoalkane to favour elimination rather than substitution use heat a concentrated solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide pure ethanol a the solvent uk a level syllabus
some thing you just have to know
the role of the hydroxide ion the role of the hydroxide ion in a substitution reaction in the substitution reaction between a halogenoalkane and ion the hydroxide ion are acting a nucleophiles
for example one of the lone pair on the oxygen can attack the slightly positive carbon
this lead on to the loss of the bromine a a bromide ion and the group becoming attached in it place
the role of the hydroxide ion in an elimination reaction hydroxide ion have a very strong tendency to combine with hydrogen ion to make water in other word the ion is a very strong base
in an elimination reaction the hydroxide ion hit one of the hydrogen atom in the ch3 group and pull it off
this lead to a cascade of electron pair movement resulting in the formation of a double bond and the loss of the bromine a
you will probably find that the question centre around secondary halogenoalkanes like because these can easily be persuaded to do either reaction
important if the elimination mechanism is on your syllabus you are quite likely to be asked question in which the substitution reaction crop up a well
if you need to revise this in detail now is a good time to do it
