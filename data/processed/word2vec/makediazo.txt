making diazonium salt from phenylamine this page look at the reaction between phenylamine also known a aniline and aminobenzene and nitrous acid particularly it reaction at temperature of less than to produce diazonium salt
if you want to know about the reaction of the diazonium ion formed you will find a link at the bottom of the page
the reaction of phenylamine with nitrous acid nitrous acid also known a nitric iii acid ha the formula hno2
it is sometimes written a hono to show the way it is joined up
nitrous acid decomposes very readily and is always made in situ
in the case of it reaction with phenylamine the phenylamine is first dissolved in hydrochloric acid and then a solution of sodium or potassium nitrite is added
the reaction between the hydrochloric acid and the nitrite ion produce the nitrous acid
you get the reaction because nitrous acid is a weak acid the position of equilibrium lie well the right
phenylamine reacts with nitrous acid differently depending on the temperature
the reaction on warming if the mixture is warmed you get a black oily product which contains phenol amongst other thing and nitrogen gas is given off
the explanation for the reaction including the reason why there is a different reaction in the hot or cold can be found on the page about reaction of diazonium ion link at the bottom of this page
the reaction at low temperature the solution of phenylamine in hydrochloric acid phenylammonium chloride solution is stood in a beaker of ice
the sodium or potassium nitrite solution is also cooled in the ice
the solution of the nitrite is then added very slowly to the phenylammonium chloride solution so that the temperature never go above
you end up with a solution containing benzenediazonium chloride the positive ion containing the group is known a a diazonium ion
the azo bit of the name refers to nitrogen
first because it is easier to show that the benzene ring and the two nitrogen atom lie in a straight line
secondly because that the way i shall need to draw it in some of it reaction to make certain structure clear
the ionic equation for the reaction is notice that the chloride ion from the acid are involved in this in any way
if you use hydrochloric acid the solution will contain benzenediazonium chloride
if you used a different acid you would just get a different salt a sulphate or hydrogensulphate for example if you used sulphuric acid
the reaction of a diazonium salt are always done with a freshly prepared solution made in this way
the solution do keep
diazonium salt are very unstable and tend to be explosive a solid
