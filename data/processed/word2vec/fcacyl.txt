the acylation of benzene this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic substitution reaction between benzene and ethanoyl chloride in the presence of an aluminium chloride catalyst
if you want the acylation mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
what is acylation
an acyl group is an alkyl group attached to a double bond
if r represents any alkyl group then an acyl group ha the formula
acylation mean substituting an acyl group into something in this case into a benzene ring
the most commonly used acyl group is
this is called the ethanoyl group
in the example which follows we are substituting a group into the ring but you could equally well use any other alkyl group instead of the ch3
the fact the most reactive substance containing an acyl group is an acyl chloride also known a an acid chloride
these have the general formula rcocl
benzene is treated with a mixture of ethanoyl chloride ch3cocl and aluminium chloride a the catalyst
a ketone called phenylethanone is formed
a family of compound containing a double bond with a hydrocarbon group either side of it
in this case there is a methyl group on one side and a benzene ring on the other
do worry too much about the name phenylethanone all that matter is that you can draw the structure
or better the aluminium chloride is written into these equation because it is acting a a catalyst
if you wanted to include it you could write alcl3 over the top of the arrow
the formation of the electrophile the electrophile is
it is formed by reaction between the ethanoyl chloride and the aluminium chloride catalyst
the electrophilic substitution mechanism stage one stage two the hydrogen is removed by the ion which wa formed at the same time a the electrophile
the aluminium chloride catalyst is in this second stage
