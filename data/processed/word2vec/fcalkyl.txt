the alkylation of benzene this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic substitution reaction between benzene and chloromethane in the presence of an aluminium chloride catalyst
any other chloroalkane would work similarly
if you want the alkylation mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
what is alkylation
alkylation mean substituting an alkyl group into something in this case into a benzene ring
a hydrogen on the ring is replaced by a group like methyl or ethyl and so on
the fact benzene is treated with a chloroalkane for example chloromethane or chloroethane in the presence of aluminium chloride a a catalyst
on this page we will look at substituting a methyl group but any other alkyl group could be used in the same way
substituting a methyl group give methylbenzene once known a toluene
or better the aluminium chloride is written into these equation because it is acting a a catalyst
if you wanted to include it you could write alcl3 over the top of the arrow
you get further methyl group substituted around the ring
you wo have to worry about this for a level
the formation of the electrophile the electrophile is
it is formed by reaction between the chloromethane and the aluminium chloride catalyst
the electrophilic substitution mechanism stage one stage two the hydrogen is removed by the ion which wa formed at the same time a the electrophile
the aluminium chloride catalyst is in this second stage
