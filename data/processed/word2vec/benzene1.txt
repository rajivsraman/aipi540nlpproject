bonding in benzene the kekulé structure for benzene c6h6 what is the kekulé structure
kekulé wa the first to suggest a sensible structure for benzene
the carbon are arranged in a hexagon and he suggested alternating double and single bond between them
each carbon atom ha a hydrogen attached to it
this diagram is often simplified by leaving out all the carbon and hydrogen atom
in diagram of this sort there is a carbon atom at each corner
you have to count the bond leaving each carbon to work out how many hydrogen there are attached to it
in this case each carbon ha three bond leaving it
because carbon atom form four bond that mean you are a bond missing and that must be attached to a hydrogen atom
problem with the kekulé structure although the kekulé structure wa a good attempt in it time there are serious problem with it
problem with the chemistry because of the three double bond you might expect benzene to have reaction like ethene only more so
ethene undergoes addition reaction in which one of the two bond joining the carbon atom break and the electron are used to bond with additional atom
benzene rarely doe this
instead it usually undergoes substitution reaction in which one of the hydrogen atom is replaced by something new
problem with the shape benzene is a planar molecule all the atom lie in one plane and that would also be true of the kekulé structure
the problem is that single and double bond are different length
that would mean that the hexagon would be irregular if it had the kekulé structure with alternating shorter and longer side
in real benzene all the bond are exactly the same intermediate in length between and at nm
real benzene is a perfectly regular hexagon
problem with the stability of benzene real benzene is a lot more stable than the kekulé structure would give it credit for
every time you do a thermochemistry calculation based on the kekulé structure you get an answer which is wrong by about 150 kj
this is most easily shown using enthalpy change of hydrogenation
help
it doe matter whether you done any thermochemistry sum recently or not
this is all so simple that you could understand it even if you had never done any
hydrogenation is the addition of hydrogen to something
if for example you hydrogenate ethene you get ethane in order to do a fair comparison with benzene a ring structure we going to compare it with cyclohexene
cyclohexene c6h10 is a ring of six carbon atom containing just one
bond
when hydrogen is added to this cyclohexane c6h12 is formed
the ch group become ch2 and the double bond is replaced by a single one
no bond
the structure of cyclohexene and cyclohexane are usually simplified in the same way that the kekulé structure for benzene is simplified by leaving out all the carbon and hydrogen
in the cyclohexane case for example there is a carbon atom at each corner and enough hydrogen to make the total bond on each carbon atom up to four
in this case then each corner represents ch2
the hydrogenation equation could be written the enthalpy change during this reaction is kj
in other word when 1 mole of cyclohexene reacts 120 kj of heat energy is evolved
the enthalpy change during this reaction is kj
in other word when 1 mole of cyclohexene reacts 120 kj of heat energy is evolved
help
enthalpy change can be translated a heat evolved or absorbed
the negative sign show that heat is evolved
where doe this heat energy come from
when the reaction happens bond are broken and and this cost energy
other bond have to be made and this release energy
because the bond made are stronger than those broken more energy is released than wa used to break the original bond and so there is a net evolution of heat energy
if the ring had two double bond in it initially exactly twice a many bond would have to be broken and exactly twice a many made
in other word you would expect the enthalpy change of hydrogenation of to be exactly twice that of cyclohexene that is kj
do worry about it unless you want to
in fact the enthalpy change is kj which is far off what we are predicting
applying the same argument to the kekulé structure for benzene what might be called you would expect an enthalpy change of kj because there are exactly three time a many bond being broken and made a in the cyclohexene case
in fact what you get is kj not even within distance of the predicted value
this is very much easier to see on an enthalpy diagram
notice that in each case heat energy is released and in each case the product is the same cyclohexane
that mean that all the reaction fall down to the same end point
heavy line solid arrow and bold number represent real change
predicted change are shown by dotted line and italic
the most important point to notice is that real benzene is much lower down the diagram than the kekulé form predicts
the lower down a substance is the more energetically stable it is
this mean that real benzene is about 150 kj more stable than the kekulé structure give it credit for
this increase in stability of benzene is known a the delocalisation energy or resonance energy of benzene
the first term delocalisation energy is the more commonly used
there is a tiny amount of delocalisation energy involved here a well
why is benzene so much more stable than the kekulé structure suggests
