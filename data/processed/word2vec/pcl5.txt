converting carboxylic acid into acyl chloride acid chloride this page look at way of swapping the group in the group of a carboxylic acid for a chlorine atom
this produce useful compound called acyl chloride acid chloride
it cover the use of phosphorus v chloride and phosphorus iii chloride a well a sulphur dichloride oxide thionyl chloride
replacing by introduction we are going to be looking at converting a carboxylic acid rcooh into an acyl chloride rcocl
acyl chloride are also known a acid chloride
by far the most commonly used example of the conversion of a carboxylic acid into an acyl chloride is ethanoic acid to ethanoyl chloride
acyl chloride are very reactive and can be used to make a wide range of other thing
that why they are important
replacing the group using phosphorus v chloride pcl5 phosphorus v chloride is a solid which reacts with carboxylic acid in the cold to give steamy acidic fume of hydrogen chloride
it leaf a liquid mixture of the acyl chloride and a phosphorus compound phosphorus trichloride oxide phosphorus oxychloride pocl3
the acyl chloride can be separated by fractional distillation
for example replacing the group using phosphorus iii chloride pcl3 phosphorus iii chloride is a liquid at room temperature
it reaction with a carboxylic acid is less dramatic than that of phosphorus v chloride because there is no hydrogen chloride produced
you end up with a mixture of the acyl chloride and phosphoric iii acid old name phosphorous acid or orthophosphorous acid h3po3
for example again the ethanoyl chloride can be separated by fractional distillation
replacing the group using sulphur dichloride oxide thionyl chloride sulphur dichloride oxide thionyl chloride is a liquid at room temperature and ha the formula socl2
traditionally the formula is written a shown despite the fact that the modern name writes the chlorine before the oxygen alphabetical order
the sulphur dichloride oxide reacts with carboxylic acid to produce an acyl chloride and sulphur dioxide and hydrogen chloride gas are given off
for example the separation is simplified to an extent because the are both gas
you would obviously still have to fractionally distil the mixture to separate the acyl chloride from any excess acid or sulphur dichloride oxide
