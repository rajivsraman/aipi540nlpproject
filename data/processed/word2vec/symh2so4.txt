the reaction between symmetrical alkene and sulphuric acid this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic addition reaction between sulphuric acid and alkene like ethene and cyclohexene
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact alkene react with concentrated sulphuric acid in the cold to produce alkyl hydrogensulphates
ethene reacts to give ethyl hydrogensulphate
the structure of the product molecule is sometimes written a ch3ch2hso4 but the version in the equation is better because it show how all the atom are linked up
you may also find it written a ch3ch2oso3h
confused by all this
do be
all you need to do is to learn the structure of sulphuric acid and after that the mechanism is exactly the same a the one with hydrogen bromide
a you will find out the formula of the product follows from the mechanism in an inevitable way
important
learn this structure for sulphuric acid
sketch it over and over again until you ca possibly get it wrong
the mechanism for the reaction between ethene and sulphuric acid sulphuric acid a an electrophile the hydrogen atom are attached to very electronegative oxygen atom which mean that the hydrogen will have a slight positive charge while the oxygen will be slightly negative
in the mechanism we just focus on one of the hydrogen to oxygen bond because the other one is too far from the double bond to be involved in any way
the mechanism look carefully at the structure of the product so that you can see how it relates to the various formula given earlier ch3ch2oso2oh etc
this time we are going straight for the mechanism without producing an initial equation
this is to show that you can work out the structure of obscure product provided you can write the mechanism
the mechanism for the reaction between cyclohexene and sulphuric acid having worked out the structure of the product you could then write a simple equation for the reaction if you wanted to
