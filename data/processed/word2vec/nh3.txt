reaction between halogenoalkanes and ammonia this page look at the reaction between halogenoalkanes haloalkane or alkyl halide and ammonia
this is a potentially very complicated series of reaction so it is important to know exactly what your examiner want
you need to check your syllabus and past exam paper and mark scheme
important
if you are working towards a exam a level or equivalent and do have any of this information then it is essential that you get it
find out how by going to the syllabus page
the current page summarises the main fact about the reaction
if you need detail about the mechanism you will find a link below
reaction detail and product the halogenoalkane is heated with a concentrated solution of ammonia in ethanol
the reaction is carried out in a sealed tube
you could heat this mixture under reflux because the ammonia would simply escape up the condenser a a gas
we talk about the reaction using a a typical primary halogenoalkane
there is no difference in the detail of the reaction if you chose a secondary or tertiary halogenoalkane instead
the equation would just look more complicated than they already are
you get a series of amine formed together with their salt
the reaction happen one after another
making a primary amine the reaction happens in two stage
in the first stage a salt is formed in this case ethylammonium bromide
this is just like ammonium bromide except that one of the hydrogen in the ammonium ion is replaced by an ethyl group
there is then the possibility of a reversible reaction between this salt and excess ammonia in the mixture
the ammonia remove a hydrogen ion from the ethylammonium ion to leave a primary amine ethylamine
the more ammonia there is in the mixture the more the forward reaction is favoured
some of the information you come across is simply wrong

making a secondary amine the reaction doe stop at a primary amine
the ethylamine also reacts with bromoethane in the same two stage a before
in the first stage you get a salt formed this time diethylammonium bromide
think of this a ammonium bromide with two hydrogen replaced by ethyl group
there is again the possibility of a reversible reaction between this salt and excess ammonia in the mixture
the ammonia remove a hydrogen ion from the diethylammonium ion to leave a secondary amine diethylamine
a secondary amine is one which ha two alkyl group attached to the nitrogen
making a tertiary amine and still it doe stop
the diethylamine also reacts with bromoethane in the same two stage a before
in the first stage you get triethylammonium bromide
there is again the possibility of a reversible reaction between this salt and excess ammonia in the mixture
the ammonia remove a hydrogen ion from the triethylammonium ion to leave a tertiary amine triethylamine
a tertiary amine is one which ha three alkyl group attached to the nitrogen
making a quaternary ammonium salt the final stage
the triethylamine reacts with bromoethane to give tetraethylammonium bromide a quaternary ammonium salt one in which all four hydrogen have been replaced by alkyl group
this time there is any hydrogen left on the nitrogen to be removed
the reaction stop here
it is much much easier to work it out if you need to provided you understand the mechanism for the reaction
you can explore the mechanism for the various stage of the reaction by following this link
this will lead you to several page in the mechanism section of this site
if all you want to do is make some sense of the above reaction it would probably pay you to just read the part of those page concerned with primary halogenoalkanes like bromoethane
what do you actually get if you react bromoethane with ammonia
whatever you do you get a mixture of all of the product including both amine and their salt shown on this page
to get mainly the quaternary ammonium salt you can use a large excess of bromoethane
if you look at the reaction going on each one need additional bromoethane
if you provide enough then the chance are that the reaction will go to completion given enough time
on the other hand if you use a very large excess of ammonia the chance are always greatest that a bromoethane molecule will hit an ammonia molecule rather than one of the amine being formed
that will help to prevent the formation of secondary etc amine
