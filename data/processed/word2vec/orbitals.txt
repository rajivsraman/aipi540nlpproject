electronic structure and atomic orbitals a simple view in any introductory chemistry course you will have come across the electronic structure of hydrogen and carbon drawn a a level
it is however a simplification and can be misleading
it give the impression that the electron are circling the nucleus in orbit like planet around the sun
a you will see in a moment it is impossible to know exactly how they are actually moving
the circle show energy level representing increasing distance from the nucleus
you could straighten the circle out and draw the electronic structure a a simple energy diagram
atomic orbitals orbit and orbitals sound similar but they have quite different meaning
it is essential that you understand the difference between them
the impossibility of drawing orbit for electron to plot a path for something you need to know exactly where the object is and be able to work out exactly where it going to be an instant later
you ca do this for electron
equally it no use knowing that it is travelling at 500 mph due west if you have no idea whether it is near iceland or the azores at that particular moment
the heisenberg uncertainty principle not required at say loosely that you ca know with certainty both where an electron is and where it going next
that make it impossible to plot an orbit for an electron around a nucleus
is this a big problem
no
if something is impossible you have to accept it and find a way around it
hydrogen electron the 1 orbital this is just for clarity
suppose you had a single hydrogen atom and at a particular instant plotted the position of the one electron
soon afterwards you do the same thing and find that it is in a new position
you have no idea how it got from the first place to the second
you keep on doing this over and over again and gradually build up a sort of 3d map of the place that the electron is likely to be found
in the hydrogen case the electron can be found anywhere within a spherical space surrounding the nucleus
the diagram show a through this spherical space
95 of the time or any other percentage you choose the electron will be found within a fairly easily defined region of space quite close to the nucleus
such a region of space is called an orbital
you can think of an orbital a being the region of space in which the electron life
universe
what is the electron doing in the orbital
we do know we ca know and so we just ignore the problem
all you can say is that if an electron is in a particular orbital it will have a particular definable energy
each orbital ha a name
the orbital occupied by the hydrogen electron is called a 1 orbital
the 1 represents the fact that the orbital is in the energy level closest to the nucleus
the s tell you about the shape of the orbital
s orbitals are spherically symmetric around the nucleus in each case like a hollow ball made of rather chunky material with the nucleus at it centre
the orbital on the left is a 2 orbital
this is similar to a 1 orbital except that the region where there is the greatest chance of finding the electron is further from the nucleus this is an orbital at the second energy level
if you look carefully you will notice that there is another region of slightly higher electron density where the dot are thicker nearer the nucleus
electron density is another way of talking about how likely you are to find an electron at a particular place
2 and 3 4 etc electron spend some of their time closer to the nucleus than you might expect
the effect of this is to slightly reduce the energy of electron in s orbitals
the nearer the nucleus the electron get the lower their energy
3 4 etc orbitals get progressively further from the nucleus
p orbitals not all electron inhabit s orbitals in fact very few electron live in s orbitals
at the first energy level the only orbital available to electron is the 1 orbital but at the second level a well a a 2 orbital there are also orbitals called 2p orbitals
a p orbital is rather like 2 identical balloon tied together at the nucleus
the diagram on the right is a through that region of space
once again the orbital show where there is a 95 chance of finding a particular electron
not all electron inhabit s orbitals in fact very few electron live in s orbitals
at the first energy level the only orbital available to electron is the 1 orbital but at the second level a well a a 2 orbital there are also orbitals called 2p orbitals
a p orbital is rather like 2 identical balloon tied together at the nucleus
the diagram on the right is a through that region of space
once again the orbital show where there is a 95 chance of finding a particular electron
beyond if you imagine a horizontal plane through the nucleus with one lobe of the orbital above the plane and the other beneath it there is a zero probability of finding the electron on that plane
so how doe the electron get from one lobe to the other if it can never pas through the plane of the nucleus
for chemistry you just have to accept that it doe
if you want to find out more read about the wave nature of electron
unlike an s orbital a p orbital point in a particular direction the one drawn point up and down the page
at any one energy level it is possible to have three absolutely equivalent p orbitals pointing mutually at right angle to each other
these are arbitrarily given the symbol px py and pz
this is simply for convenience what you might think of a the x y or z direction change constantly a the atom tumble in space
the p orbitals at the second energy level are called 2px 2py and 2pz
there are similar orbitals at subsequent level 3px 3py 3pz 4px 4py 4pz and so on
all level except for the first level have p orbitals
at the higher level the lobe get more elongated with the most likely place to find the electron more distant from the nucleus
fitting electron into orbitals because for the moment we are only interested in the electronic structure of hydrogen and carbon we do need to concern ourselves with what happens beyond the second energy level
remember at the first level there is only one orbital the 1 orbital
at the second level there are four orbitals the 2 2px 2py and 2pz orbitals
each orbital can hold either 1 or 2 electron but no more
orbitals can be represented a box with the electron in them shown a arrow
often an and a are used to show that the electron are in some way different
beyond the need to have all electron in an atom different come out of quantum theory
if they live in different orbitals that fine but if they are both in the same orbital there ha to be some subtle distinction between them
quantum theory allocates them a property known a spin which is what the arrow are intended to suggest
a 1 orbital holding 2 electron would be drawn a shown on the right but it can be written even more quickly a 1s2
this is read a one s two not a one s squared
you must confuse the two number in this notation the order of filling orbitals electron fill low energy orbitals closer to the nucleus before they fill higher energy one
where there is a choice between orbitals of equal energy they fill the orbitals singly a far a possible
the diagram not to scale summarises the energy of the various orbitals in the first and second level
notice that the 2 orbital ha a slightly lower energy than the 2p orbitals
that mean that the 2 orbital will fill with electron before the 2p orbitals
all the 2p orbitals have exactly the same energy
the electronic structure of hydrogen hydrogen only ha one electron and that will go into the orbital with the lowest energy the 1 orbital
hydrogen ha an electronic structure of 1s1
we have already described this orbital earlier
the electronic structure of carbon carbon ha six electron
two of them will be found in the 1 orbital close to the nucleus
the next two will go into the 2 orbital
the remaining one will be in two separate 2p orbitals
this is because the p orbitals all have the same energy and the electron prefer to be on their own if that the case
they do
all of the 2p orbitals are exactly equivalent and the name we give them are entirely arbitrary
it just look tidier if we call the orbitals the electron occupy the 2px and 2py
the electronic structure of carbon is normally written 1s22s22px12py1
