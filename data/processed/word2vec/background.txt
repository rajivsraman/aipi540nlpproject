introducing phenylamine this page look at the structure and physical property of phenylamine also known a aniline or aminobenzene
phenylamine ha an group attached directly to a benzene ring
the structure of phenylamine phenylamine is a primary amine a compound in which one of the hydrogen atom in an ammonia molecule ha been replaced by a hydrocarbon group
however in comparison with simple primary amine like methylamine the property of phenylamine are slightly different
this is because the lone pair on the nitrogen atom interacts with the delocalised electron in the benzene ring
the simplest way to draw the structure of phenylamine is you need to understand about the bonding in benzene in order to make sense of this next bit
if you follow this link you may have to explore several other page before you are ready to come back here again
or history file or go menu on your browser to return to this page
there is an interaction between the delocalised electron in the benzene ring and the lone pair on the nitrogen atom
the lone pair overlap with the delocalised ring electron system
giving a structure rather like this the donation of the nitrogen lone pair into the ring system increase the electron density around the ring
that make the ring much more reactive than it is in benzene itself
uk a level chemistry syllabus so i have followed this up anywhere on this site
it also reduces the availability of the lone pair on the nitrogen to take part in other reaction
in particular it make phenylamine much more weakly basic than primary amine where the group is attached to a benzene ring
that will be explored elsewhere in this section
see the phenylamine menu link at the bottom of this page
physical property pure phenylamine is a colourless liquid but it darkens rapidly on exposure to light and air
it is normally a brown oily liquid
melting and boiling point it is useful to compare phenylamine melting and boiling point with those of methylbenzene toluene
both molecule contain a similar number of electron and are a very similar shape
that mean that the intermolecular attraction due to van der waals dispersion force are going to be very similar
waals dispersion force and hydrogen bond then you really ought to follow this link before you go on
this section wo make much sense to you if you are familiar with the various sort of intermolecular force

the reason for the higher value for phenylamine is in part due to permanent attraction due to the electronegativity of the nitrogen but is mainly due to hydrogen bonding
hydrogen bond can form between a lone pair on a nitrogen on one molecule and the hydrogen on the group of one of it neighbour
the truth is that the delocalisation is complete
you can think of the lone pair a still being there but not a effective a it would otherwise be
solubility in water phenylamine is slightly soluble in water about g depending on where you get the data from
of phenylamine will dissolve in 100 g of water at
mixture containing more phenylamine than this separate into two layer with the phenylamine forming the bottom one
phenylamine is somewhat soluble in water because of it ability to form hydrogen bond with the water
however the benzene ring in the phenylamine break more hydrogen bond between water molecule than are reformed between water and the group
the water molecule also disrupt fairly strong van der waals attraction between the phenylamine molecule
both of these effect mean that dissolving phenylamine in water is very energetically profitable and so stop the phenylamine from being very soluble
