stereoisomerism optical isomerism optical isomerism is a form of stereoisomerism
this page explains what stereoisomers are and how you recognise the possibility of optical isomer in a molecule
what is stereoisomerism
what are isomer
isomer are molecule that have the same molecular formula but have a different arrangement of the atom in space
that excludes any different arrangement which are simply due to the molecule rotating a a whole or rotating about particular bond
where the atom making up the various isomer are joined up in a different order this is known a structural isomerism
structural isomerism is not a form of stereoisomerism and is dealt with on a separate page
what are stereoisomers
in stereoisomerism the atom making up the isomer are joined up in the same order but still manage to have a different spatial arrangement
optical isomerism is one form of stereoisomerism
optical isomerism why optical isomer
optical isomer are named like this because of their effect on plane polarised light
help
if you do understand about plane polarised light follow this link before you go on with this page
simple substance which show optical isomerism exist a two isomer known a enantiomer
a solution of one enantiomer rotates the plane of polarisation in a clockwise direction
this enantiomer is known a the form
for example one of the optical isomer enantiomer of the amino acid alanine is known a alanine
a solution of the other enantiomer rotates the plane of polarisation in an direction
this enantiomer is known a the form
so the other enantiomer of alanine is known a or alanine
if the solution are equally concentrated the amount of rotation caused by the two isomer is exactly the same but in opposite direction
when optically active substance are made in the lab they often occur a a mixture of the two enantiomer
this is known a a racemic mixture or racemate
it ha no effect on plane polarised light
bear with it thing are soon going to get more visual
there is an alternative way of describing the and form which is potentially very confusing
this involves the use of the lowercase letter and standing for dextrorotatory and laevorotatory respectively
unfortunately there is another different use of the capital letter and in this topic
this is totally confusing
stick with and
how optical isomer arise the example of organic optical isomer required at a level all contain a carbon atom joined to four different group
these two model each have the same group joined to the central carbon atom but still manage to be different obviously a they are drawn the orange and blue group are aligned the same way
could you get them to align by rotating one of the molecule
the next diagram show what happens if you rotate molecule b
they still are the same and there is no way that you can rotate them so that they look exactly the same
these are isomer of each other
they are described a being in the sense that if you imagine molecule b being turned into a ghostly version of itself you could slide one molecule exactly over the other one
something would always be pointing in the wrong direction
if your school or college ha given you the opportunity to play around with molecular model in the early stage of your organic chemistry course you might consider getting hold of a cheap set
the model made by molymod are both cheap and easy to use
an introductory organic set is more than adequate
google molymod to find a supplier and more about them or have a look at this set or this set or something similar from amazon
share the cost with some friend keep it in good condition and do lose any bit and resell it via ebay or amazon at the end of your course
alternatively get hold of some coloured plasticene or other child modelling clay and some used match and make your own
it cheaper but more difficult to get the bond angle right
what happens if two of the group attached to the central carbon atom are the same
the next diagram show this possibility
the two model are aligned exactly a before but the orange group ha been replaced by another pink one
rotating molecule b this time show that it is exactly the same a molecule a
you only get optical isomer if all four group attached to the central carbon are different
chiral and achiral molecule the essential difference between the two example we looked at lie in the symmetry of the molecule
if there are two group the same attached to the central carbon atom the molecule ha a plane of symmetry
if you imagine slicing through the molecule the side is an exact reflection of the side
where there are four group attached there is no symmetry anywhere in the molecule
a molecule which ha no plane of symmetry is described a chiral
the carbon atom with the four different group attached which cause this lack of symmetry is described a a chiral centre or a an asymmetric carbon atom
the molecule on the left above with a plane of symmetry is described a achiral
only chiral molecule have optical isomer
the relationship between the enantiomer one of the enantiomer is simply a mirror image of the other one
in other word if one isomer looked in a mirror what it would see is the other one
the two isomer the original one and it mirror image have a different spatial arrangement and so ca be superimposed on each other
if an achiral molecule one with a plane of symmetry looked in a mirror you would always find that by rotating the image in space you could make the two look identical
it would be possible to superimpose the original molecule and it mirror image
some real example of optical isomer the asymmetric carbon atom in a compound the one with four different group attached is often shown by a star
it extremely important to draw the isomer correctly
draw one of them using standard bond notation to show the arrangement around the asymmetric carbon atom
then draw the mirror to show the examiner that you know what you are doing and then the mirror image

if you do understand this bond notation follow this link to drawing organic molecule before you go on with this page
notice that you do literally draw the mirror image of all the letter and number
it is however quite useful to reverse large group look for example at the ethyl group at the top of the diagram
it doe matter in the least in what order you draw the four group around the central carbon
a long a your mirror image is drawn accurately you will automatically have drawn the two isomer
so which of these two isomer is and which is
there is no simple way of telling that
for purpose you can just ignore that problem all you need to be able to do is to draw the two isomer correctly
acid lactic acid once again the chiral centre is shown by a star
the two enantiomer are it is important this time to draw the cooh group backwards in the mirror image
if you do there is a good chance of you joining it on to the central carbon wrongly
if you draw it like this in an exam you wo get the mark for that isomer even if you have drawn everything else perfectly
acid alanine this is typical of amino acid
structurally it is just like the last example except that the group is replaced by the two enantiomer are only one of these isomer occurs naturally the form
you ca tell just by looking at the structure which this is
it ha however been possible to work out which of these structure is which
naturally occurring alanine is the structure and the way the group are arranged around the central carbon atom is known a an configuration
notice the use of the capital the other configuration is known a
so you may well find alanine described a alanine
that mean that it ha this particular structure and rotates the plane of polarisation clockwise
even if you know that a different compound ha an arrangement of group similar to alanine you still ca say which way it will rotate the plane of polarisation
the other amino acid for example have the same arrangement of group a alanine doe all that change is the ch3 group but some are form and others are form
it quite common for natural system to only work with one of the enantiomer of an optically active substance
it is too difficult to see why that might be
because the molecule have different spatial arrangement of their various group only one of them is likely to fit properly into the active site on the enzyme they work with
in the lab it is quite common to produce equal amount of both form of a compound when it is synthesised
this happens just by chance and you tend to get racemic mixture
hcn to aldehyde identifying chiral centre in skeletal formula a skeletal formula is the most formula possible
look at the structural formula and skeletal formula for
notice that in the skeletal formula all of the carbon atom have been left out a well a all of the hydrogen atom attached to carbon
in a skeletal diagram of this sort there is a carbon atom at each junction between bond in a chain and at the end of each bond unless there is something else there already like the group in the example there are enough hydrogen atom attached to each carbon to make the total number of bond on that carbon up to 4
we have already discussed the case further up the page and you know that it ha optical isomer
the second carbon atom the one with the attached ha four different group around it and so is a chiral centre
is this obvious from the skeletal formula
well it is provided you remember that each carbon atom ha to have 4 bond going away from it
since the second carbon here only seems to have 3 there must also be a hydrogen attached to that carbon
so it ha a hydrogen an group and two different hydrocarbon group methyl and ethyl
four different group around a carbon atom mean that it is a chiral centre
a slightly more complicated case the diagram show an uncluttered skeletal formula and a repeat of it with two of the carbon labelled
look first at the carbon atom labelled 2
is this a chiral centre
no it is
two bond one vertical and one to the left are both attached to methyl group
in addition of course there is a hydrogen atom and the more complicated hydrocarbon group to the right
it doe have 4 different group attached and so is a chiral centre
what about the number 3 carbon atom
this ha a methyl group below it an ethyl group to the right and a more complicated hydrocarbon group to the left
plus of course a hydrogen atom to make up the 4 bond that have to be formed by the carbon
that mean that it is attached to 4 different thing and so is a chiral centre
introducing ring further complication at the time of writing one of the exam board cambridge international cie commonly asked about the number of chiral centre in some very complicated molecule involving ring of carbon atom
the rest of this page is to teach you how to cope with these
we will start with a fairly simple ring compound when you are looking at ring like this a far a optical isomerism is concerned you do need to look at any carbon in a double bond
you also do need to look at any junction which only ha two bond going away from it
in that case there must be 2 hydrogen attached and so there ca possibly be 4 different group attached
in this case that mean that you only need to look at the carbon with the group attached
it ha an group a hydrogen to make up the total number of bond to four and link to two carbon atom
how doe the fact that these carbon atom are part of a ring affect thing
you just need to trace back around the ring from both side of the carbon you are looking at
is the arrangement in both direction exactly the same
in this case it is
going in one direction you come immediately to a carbon with a double bond
in the other direction you meet two singly bonded carbon atom and then one with a double bond
that mean that you have got two identical hydrocarbon group attached to the carbon you are interested in and so it ha 4 different group in total around it
it is asymmetric a chiral centre
what about this of the last molecule
in this case everything is a before except that if you trace around the ring clockwise and anticlockwise from the carbon at the bottom of the ring there is an identical pattern in both direction
you can think of the bottom carbon being attached to a hydrogen an group and two identical hydrocarbon group
it therefore is a chiral centre
the other thing which is very noticeable about this molecule is that there is a plane of symmetry through the carbon atom we are interested in
if you chopped it in half through this carbon one side of the molecule would be an exact reflection of the other
in the first ring molecule above that is the case
if you can see a plane of symmetry through the carbon atom it wo be a chiral centre
if there is a plane of symmetry it will be a chiral centre
a seriously complicated example cholesterol the skeletal diagram show the structure of cholesterol
some of the carbon atom have been numbered for discussion purpose below
these are not part of the normal system for numbering the carbon atom in cholesterol
before you read on look carefully at each of the numbered carbon atom and decide which of them are chiral centre
the other carbon atom in the structure ca be chiral centre because they are either part of double bond or are joined to either two or three hydrogen atom
normally when a molecule like cholesterol is discussed in this context extra detail is often added to the skeletal structure
for example important hydrogen atom or methyl group are drawn in
it is good for you to have to do it the hard way
so
how many chiral centre did you find
in fact there are 8 chiral centre out of the total of 9 carbon marked
if you did find all eight go back and have another look before you read any further
it might help to sketch the structure on a piece of paper and draw in any missing hydrogen attached to the numbered carbon and write in the methyl group at the end of the branch a well
this is done for you below but it would be a lot better if you did it yourself and then checked your sketch afterwards
starting with the easy one it is obvious that carbon 9 ha two methyl group attached
it doe have 4 different group and so ca be chiral
if you take a general look at the rest it is fairly clear that none of them ha a plane of symmetry through the numbered carbon
therefore they are all likely to be chiral centre
but it worth checking to see what is attached to each of them
carbon 1 ha a hydrogen an and two different hydrocarbon chain actually bit of ring attached
check clockwise and anticlockwise and you will see that the arrangement is identical in each direction
four different group mean a chiral centre
carbon 2 ha a methyl and three other different hydrocarbon group
if you check along all three bit of ring they are all different another chiral centre
this is also true of carbon 6
carbon 3 4 5 and 7 are all basically the same
each is attached to a hydrogen and three different bit of ring
all of these are chiral centre
finally carbon 8 ha a hydrogen a methyl group and two different hydrocarbon group attached
again this is a chiral centre
this all look difficult at first glance but it is
you do however have to take a great deal of care in working through it it is amazingly easy to miss one out
