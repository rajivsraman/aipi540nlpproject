nucleophilic addition elimination in the reaction between acyl chloride and water this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the nucleophilic addition elimination reaction between acyl chloride acid chloride and water
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
ethanoyl chloride is taken a a typical acyl chloride
any other acyl chloride will behave in the same way
simply replace the ch3 group in what follows by anything else you want
the fact ethanoyl chloride reacts instantly with cold water
there is a very exothermic reaction in which a steamy acidic gas is given off hydrogen chloride and ethanoic acid is formed
the mechanism the first stage the addition stage of the reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on the fairly positive carbon atom by one of the lone pair on the oxygen of a water molecule
this is to avoid cluttering an already complicated diagram with thing that are relevant
the second stage the elimination stage happens in two step
in the first the double bond reform and a chloride ion is pushed off
that is followed by removal of a hydrogen ion by the chloride ion to give ethanoic acid and hydrogen chloride
