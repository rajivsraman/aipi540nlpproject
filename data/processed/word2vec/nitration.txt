the nitration of benzene this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic substitution reaction between benzene and a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid
if you want the nitration mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid at a temperature not exceeding
a temperature increase there is a greater chance of getting more than one nitro group substituted onto the ring
nitrobenzene is formed
or the concentrated sulphuric acid is acting a a catalyst
the formation of the electrophile the electrophile is the nitronium ion or the nitryl cation
this is formed by reaction between the nitric acid and the sulphuric acid
