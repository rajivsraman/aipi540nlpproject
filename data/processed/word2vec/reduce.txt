the reduction of aldehyde and ketone this page give you the fact and mechanism for the reduction of carbonyl compound specifically aldehyde and ketone using sodium tetrahydridoborate sodium borohydride a the reducing agent
only one uk a level exam board aqa is likely to ask for these mechanism and they are happy with a simplified version of what is quite a complex mechanism
because of that simplification these reaction are dealt with entirely on this page without the talk through page that you will find for other mechanism on this site
the fact sodium tetrahydridoborate previously known a sodium borohydride ha the formula nabh4 and contains the ion
that ion act a the reducing agent
there are several quite different way of carrying out this reaction
two possible variant there are several others
are the reaction is carried out in solution in water to which some sodium hydroxide ha been added to make it alkaline
the reaction produce an intermediate which is converted into the final product by addition of a dilute acid like sulphuric acid
the reaction is carried out in solution in an alcohol like methanol ethanol or
this produce an intermediate which can be converted into the final product by boiling it with water
in each case reduction essentially involves the addition of a hydrogen atom to each end of the double bond to form an alcohol
reduction of aldehyde and ketone lead to two different sort of alcohol
the reduction of an aldehyde for example with ethanal you get ethanol notice that this is a simplified equation perfectly acceptable to examiner
the h in square bracket mean hydrogen from a reducing agent
in general term reduction of an aldehyde lead to a primary alcohol
a primary alcohol is one which only ha one alkyl group attached to the carbon with the group on it
they all contain the grouping
methanol ch3oh is also a primary alcohol
think of this a
the reduction of a ketone for example with propanone you get reduction of a ketone lead to a secondary alcohol
a secondary alcohol is one which ha two alkyl group attached to the carbon with the group on it
they all contain the grouping
beware
the following mechanism are simplified for uk a level purpose to the point that they are wrong
if you are working outside the uk a level system please do read any further
the simplified mechanism the ion is essentially a source of hydride ion
the simplification used is to write instead of
doing this not only make the initial attack easier to write but avoids you getting involved with some quite complicated boron compound that are formed a intermediate
the reduction is an example of nucleophilic addition
the double bond is highly polar and the slightly positive carbon atom is attacked by the hydride ion acting a a nucleophile
a hydride ion is a hydrogen atom with an extra electron hence the lone pair
nucleophile a specie molecule or ion which attack a positive site in something else
nucleophiles are either fully negative ion or contain a fairly negative region somewhere in a molecule
all nucleophiles have at least one active lone pair of electron
when you write mechanism for reaction involving nucleophiles you must show that lone pair
the mechanism for the reduction of ethanal in the first stage there is a nucleophilic attack by the hydride ion on the slightly positive carbon atom
the lone pair of electron on the hydride ion form a bond with the carbon and the electron in one of the bond are repelled entirely onto the oxygen giving it a negative charge
what happens now depends on whether you add an acid or water to complete the reaction
adding an acid when the acid is added the negative ion formed pick up a hydrogen ion to give an alcohol
that not good practice because it suggests a free hydrogen ion
the hydrogen ion is actually attached to a water molecule a
writing that make the equation look more complicated
aq is a happy compromise
adding water this time the negative ion take a hydrogen ion from a water molecule
the mechanism for the reduction of propanone a before the reaction start with a nucleophilic attack by the hydride ion on the slightly positive carbon atom
again what happens next depends on whether you add an acid or water to complete the reaction
adding an acid the negative ion reacts with a hydrogen ion from the acid added in the second stage of the reaction
adding water this time the negative ion take a hydrogen ion from a water molecule

remember that the equation and mechanism given on this page are not the truth they are merely simplification to suit the demand of a particular a level syllabus
