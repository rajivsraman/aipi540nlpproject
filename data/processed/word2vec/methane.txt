bonding in methane and ethane if you are happy with describing electron arrangement in s and p notation and with the shape of s and p orbitals you really should read about orbitals
on your browser to return quickly to this point
methane ch4 the simple view of the bonding in methane you will be familiar with drawing methane using dot and cross diagram but it is worth looking at it structure a bit more closely
there is a serious between this structure and the modern electronic structure of carbon 1s22s22px12py1
the modern structure show that there are only 2 unpaired electron to share with hydrogen instead of the 4 which the simple view requires
you can see this more readily using the notation
only the electron are shown
the 1s2 electron are too deep inside the atom to be involved in bonding
the only electron directly available for sharing are the 2p electron
why then is methane ch2
promotion of an electron when bond are formed energy is released and the system becomes more stable
if carbon form 4 bond rather than 2 twice a much energy is released and so the resulting molecule becomes even more stable
there is only a small energy gap between the 2 and 2p orbitals and so it pay the carbon to provide a small amount of energy to promote an electron from the 2 to the empty 2p to give 4 unpaired electron
the extra energy released when the bond form more than compensates for the initial input
the carbon atom is now said to be in an excited state
the reason for this is actually fairly complicated well beyond the level we are working at
just get in the habit of writing it like this because it make the diagram look tidy
now that we got 4 unpaired electron ready for bonding another problem arises
in methane all the bond are identical but our electron are in two different kind of orbitals
you are going to get four identical bond unless you start from four identical orbitals
hybridisation the electron rearrange themselves again in a process called hybridisation
this reorganises the electron into four identical hybrid orbitals called sp3 hybrid because they are made from one s orbital and three p orbitals
you should read sp3 a s p three not a s p cubed
sp3 hybrid orbitals look a bit like half a p orbital and they arrange themselves in space so that they are a far apart a possible
you can picture the nucleus a being at the centre of a tetrahedron a triangularly based pyramid with the orbitals pointing to the corner
for clarity the nucleus is drawn far larger than it really is
what happens when the bond are formed
remember that hydrogen electron is in a 1 orbital a spherically symmetric region of space surrounding the nucleus where there is some fixed chance say 95 of finding the electron
when a covalent bond is formed the atomic orbitals the orbitals in the individual atom merge to produce a new molecular orbital which contains the electron pair which creates the bond
four molecular orbitals are formed looking rather like the original sp3 hybrid but with a hydrogen nucleus embedded in each lobe
each orbital hold the 2 electron that we previously drawn a a dot and a cross
the principle involved promotion of electron if necessary then hybridisation followed by the formation of molecular orbitals can be applied to any molecule
the shape of methane when sp3 orbitals are formed they arrange themselves so that they are a far apart a possible
that is a tetrahedral arrangement with an angle of
nothing change in term of the shape when the hydrogen atom combine with the carbon and so the methane molecule is also tetrahedral with bond angle
ethane c2h6 the formation of molecular orbitals in ethane ethane is particularly important in it own right but is included because it is a simple example of how a single bond is formed
each carbon atom in the ethane promotes an electron and then form sp3 hybrid exactly a we described in methane
so just before bonding the atom look like this the hydrogen bond with the two carbon to produce molecular orbitals just a they did with methane
the two carbon atom bond by merging their remaining sp3 hybrid orbitals to make a new molecular orbital
the bond formed by this overlap is called a sigma bond
the bond between the carbon and hydrogen are also sigma bond
in any sigma bond the most likely place to find the pair of electron is on a line between the two nucleus
the shape of ethane around each carbon atom the shape is again determined by the way the sp3 orbitals are arranged around each carbon atom
that is a tetrahedral arrangement with an angle of
when the ethane molecule is put together the arrangement around each carbon atom is again tetrahedral with approximately bond angle
why only approximately
this time each carbon atom doe have four identical thing attached
there will be a small amount of distortion because of the attachment of 3 hydrogen and 1 carbon rather than 4 hydrogen
free rotation about the single bond the two end of this molecule can spin quite freely about the sigma bond so that there are in a sense an infinite number of possibility for the shape of an ethane molecule
some possible shape are in each case the left hand ch3 group ha been kept in a constant position so that you can see the effect of spinning the right hand one
other alkane all other alkane will be bonded in the same way the carbon atom will each promote an electron and then hybridise to give sp3 hybrid orbitals
the carbon atom will join to each other by forming sigma bond by the overlap of their sp3 hybrid orbitals
hydrogen atom will join on wherever they are needed by overlapping their 1s1 orbitals with sp3 hybrid orbitals on the carbon atom
