reducing nitrile to primary amine this page look at the reduction of nitrile to primary amine using either lithium tetrahydridoaluminate iii lithium aluminium hydride or hydrogen and a metal catalyst
the reduction of nitrile using lialh4 the reducing agent despite it name the structure of the reducing agent is very simple
there are four hydrogen tetrahydido around the aluminium in a negative ion shown by the ate ending
the iii show the oxidation state of the aluminium and is often left out because aluminium only ever show the oxidation state in it compound
to make the name shorter that what i shall do for the rest of this page
the structure of lialh4 is in the negative ion one of the bond is a covalent dative covalent bond using the lone pair on a hydride ion to form a bond with an empty orbital on the aluminium
again it is particularly important a far a the current page is concerned

the overall reaction the nitrile reacts with the lithium tetrahydridoaluminate in solution in ethoxyethane diethyl ether or just ether followed by treatment of the product of that reaction with a dilute acid
overall the triple bond is reduced to give a primary amine
primary amine contain the group
for example with ethanenitrile you get ethylamine notice that this is a simplified equation perfectly acceptable to uk a level examiner
mean hydrogen from a reducing agent
nabh4
however nabh4 is a strong enough reducing agent to reduce nitrile
the reduction of nitrile using hydrogen and a metal catalyst the triple bond in a nitrile can also be reduced by reaction with hydrogen gas in the presence of a variety of metal catalyst
commonly quoted catalyst are palladium platinum or nickel
the reaction will take place at a raised temperature and pressure
it is impossible to give exact detail because it will vary from catalyst to catalyst
for example ethanenitrile can be reduced to ethylamine by reaction with hydrogen in the presence of a palladium catalyst
h2
this is a proper equation involving hydrogen gas not a simplification
