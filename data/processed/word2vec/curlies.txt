using curly arrow in reaction mechanism this page explains the use of curly arrow to show the movement both of electron pair and of single electron during organic reaction mechanism
you can jump straight to the movement of single electron further down this page if that is all you are interested in for the moment for example if you are currently working on free radical reaction
using curly arrow to show the movement of electron pair curly arrow and that exactly what they are called
are used in mechanism to show the various electron pair moving around
you must use them for any other purpose
the arrow tail is where the electron pair start from
that always fairly obvious but you must show the electron pair either a a bond or if it is a lone pair a a pair of dot
remember that a lone pair is a pair of electron at the bonding level which is currently being used to join on to anything else
the arrow head is where you want the electron pair to end up
for example in the reaction between ethene and hydrogen bromide one of the two bond between the two carbon atom break
that bond is simply a pair of electron
those electron move to form a new bond with the hydrogen from the hbr
at the same time the pair of electron in the bond move down on to the bromine atom
there no need to draw the pair of electron in the bond a two dot
drawing the bond a a line is enough but you could put two dot in a well if you wanted to
notice that the arrow head point between the c and h because that where the electron pair end up
notice also that the electron movement between the h and br is shown a a curly arrow even though the electron pair move straight down
you have to show electron pair movement a curly arrow not a straight one
the second stage of this reaction nicely illustrates how you use a curly arrow if a lone pair of electron is involved
the first stage leaf you with a positive charge on the right hand carbon atom and a negative bromide ion
you can think of the electron shown on the bromide ion a being the one which originally made up the bond
these are normally shown because they do actually do anything new and interesting
however it is essential that you show the lone pair you are interested in a a pair of dot
if you do you risk losing mark in an exam
the lone pair on the bromide ion move to form a new bond between the bromine and the right hand carbon atom
that movement is again shown by a curly arrow
notice again that the curly arrow point between the carbon and the bromine because that where the electron pair end up
that leaf you with the product of this reaction bromoethane using curly arrow to show the movement of single electron the most common use of curly arrow is to show the movement of pair of electron
you can also use similar arrow to show the movement of single electron except that the head of these arrow only have a single line rather than two line
show the movement of an electron pair show the movement of a single electron the first stage of the polymerisation of ethene for example could be shown a you should draw the dot showing the interesting electron
the half arrow show where they go
this is very much a job and the arrow do add much
whether you choose to use these half arrow to show the movement of a single electron should be governed by what your syllabus say
if your syllabus encourages the use of these arrow then it make sense to use them
if not if the syllabus say that they may be used or just ignores them altogether then they are a well avoided
there is some danger of confusing them with the arrow showing electron pair movement which you will use all the time
if by mistake you use an ordinary full arrow to show the movement of a single electron you run the risk of losing mark
