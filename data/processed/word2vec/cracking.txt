cracking alkane this page describes what cracking is and the difference between catalytic cracking thermal cracking and steam cracking used in the petrochemical industry
cracking what is cracking
cracking is the name given to breaking up large hydrocarbon molecule into smaller and more useful bit
this is achieved by using high pressure and temperature without a catalyst or lower temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst
the source of the large hydrocarbon molecule is often the naphtha fraction or the gas oil fraction from the fractional distillation of crude oil petroleum
these fraction are obtained from the distillation process a liquid but are before cracking
there is any single unique reaction happening in the cracker
the hydrocarbon molecule are broken up in a fairly random way to produce mixture of smaller hydrocarbon some of which have double bond
one possible reaction involving the hydrocarbon c15h32 might be or showing more clearly what happens to the various atom and bond this is only one way in which this particular molecule might break up
the ethene and propene are important material for making plastic or producing other organic chemical
the octane is one of the molecule found in petrol gasoline
catalytic cracking modern cracking us zeolite a the catalyst
these are complex aluminosilicates and are large lattice of aluminium silicon and oxygen atom carrying a negative charge
they are of course associated with positive ion such a sodium ion
you may have come across a zeolite if you know about ion exchange resin used in water softener
the alkane is brought into contact with the catalyst at a temperature of about and moderately low pressure
the zeolite used in catalytic cracking are chosen to give high percentage of hydrocarbon with between 5 and 10 carbon atom particularly useful for petrol gasoline
it also produce high proportion of branched alkane and aromatic hydrocarbon like benzene
for uk a level and equivalent purpose you are expected to know how the catalyst work but you may be expected to know that it involves an ionic intermediate

the zeolite catalyst ha site which can remove a hydrogen from an alkane together with the two electron which bound it to the carbon
that leaf the carbon atom with a positive charge
ion like this are called carbonium ion or carbocations
reorganisation of these lead to the various product of the reaction
it will lead you to information on reforming and isomerisation a well a a repeat of what you have just read about catalytic cracking

thermal cracking in thermal cracking high temperature typically in the range of to and pressure up to about 70 atmosphere are used to break the large hydrocarbon into smaller one
thermal cracking give mixture of product containing high proportion of hydrocarbon with double bond alkene
this is a gross oversimplification and is written to satisfy the need of one of the uk a level exam board aqa
in fact there are several version of thermal cracking designed to produce different mixture of product
these use completely different set of condition
if you need to know about thermal cracking in detail a google search on thermal cracking will throw up lot of useful lead
be careful to go to industry or similarly reliable source
thermal cracking doe go via ionic intermediate like catalytic cracking
instead bond are broken so that each carbon atom end up with a single electron
in other word free radical are formed
reaction of the free radical lead to the various product
steam cracking steam cracking is useful because it produce a high proportion of alkene in the cracked mixture
it us the naphtha or sometimes gas oil fraction a the feedstock a well a more simple hydrocarbon like ethane propane or butane
these are vaporised and mixed with steam and passed through a reactor heated to about 800
the pressure of the mixture is around 1 atmosphere
the gas flow is very very fast so that the mixture only remains in the reactor for less than a second
this is to prevent the hydrocarbon cracking to produce carbon
the steam play no chemical part in the process serving mainly to dilute the organic feedstock
this help to prevent the formation of carbon
