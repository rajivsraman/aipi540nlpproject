the sulphonation of benzene this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic substitution reaction between benzene and sulphuric acid or sulphur trioxide
if you want this mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact there are two equivalent way of sulphonating benzene heat benzene under reflux with concentrated sulphuric acid for several hour
warm benzene under reflux at with fuming sulphuric acid for 20 to 30 minute
or the product is benzenesulphonic acid
the electrophile is actually sulphur trioxide so3 and you may find the equation for the sulphonation reaction written if the question refers to the reaction with sulphuric acid then you must use that one
if the question refers to so3 a the electrophile then you could use this one
the formation of the electrophile the sulphur trioxide electrophile arises in one of two way depending on which sort of acid you are using
concentrated sulphuric acid contains trace of so3 due to slight dissociation of the acid
fuming sulphuric acid h2s2o7 can be thought of a a solution of so3 in sulphuric acid and so is a much richer source of the so3
sulphur trioxide is an electrophile because it is a highly polar molecule with a fair amount of positive charge on the sulphur atom
it is this which is attracted to the ring electron
the electrophilic substitution mechanism stage one stage two the second stage of the reaction involves a transfer of the hydrogen from the ring to the negative oxygen
