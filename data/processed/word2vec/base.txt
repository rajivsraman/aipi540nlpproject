amine a base this page look at the reaction of amine a base
their basic property include the reaction with dilute acid water and copper ii ion
it only deal with amine where the functional group is not attached directly to a benzene ring
aromatic amine such a phenylamine aniline are much weaker base than the amine discussed on this page and are dealt with separately on a page specifically about phenylamine
if you are interested in phenylamine read this page first and then follow the link at the bottom
the basic property of amine we are going to have to use two different definition of the term base in this page
a base is a substance which combine with hydrogen ion
this is the theory
an electron pair donor
this is the lewis theory
the easiest way of looking at the basic property of amine is to think of an amine a a modified ammonia molecule
in an amine one or more of the hydrogen atom in ammonia ha been replaced by a hydrocarbon group
replacing the hydrogen still leaf the lone pair on the nitrogen unchanged and it is the lone pair on the nitrogen that give ammonia it basic property
amine will therefore behave much the same a ammonia in all case where the lone pair is involved
the reaction of amine with acid these are most easily considered using the theory of acid and base the base is a hydrogen ion acceptor
we do a straight comparison between amine and the familiar ammonia reaction
a reminder about the ammonia reaction ammonia reacts with acid to produce ammonium ion
the ammonia molecule pick up a hydrogen ion from the acid and attache it to the lone pair on the nitrogen
if the reaction is in solution in water using a dilute acid the ammonia take a hydrogen ion a proton from a hydroxonium ion
remember that hydrogen ion present in solution of acid in water are carried on water molecule a hydroxonium ion
if the acid wa hydrochloric acid for example you would end up with a solution containing ammonium chloride the chloride ion of course coming from the hydrochloric acid
you could also write this last equation a
but if you do it this way you must include the state symbol
if you write on it own it implies an unattached hydrogen ion a proton
such thing do exist on their own in solution in water
if the reaction is happening in the gas state the ammonia accepts a proton directly from the hydrogen chloride this time you produce cloud of white solid ammonium chloride
the corresponding reaction with amine the nitrogen lone pair behaves exactly the same
the fact that one or more of the hydrogen in the ammonia ha been replaced by a hydrocarbon group make no difference
for example with ethylamine if the reaction is done in solution the amine take a hydrogen ion from a hydroxonium ion and form an ethylammonium ion
or the solution would contain ethylammonium chloride or sulphate or whatever
alternatively the amine will react with hydrogen chloride in the gas state to produce the same sort of white smoke a ammonia did but this time of ethylammonium chloride
these example have involved a primary amine
it would make no real difference if you used a secondary or tertiary one
the equation would just look more complicated
the product ion from diethylamine and triethylamine would be diethylammonium ion and triethylammonium ion respectively
the reaction of amine with water again it is easiest to use the theory and again it is useful to do a straight comparison with ammonia
a reminder about the ammonia reaction with water ammonia is a weak base and take a hydrogen ion from a water molecule to produce ammonium ion and hydroxide ion
however the ammonia is only a weak base and doe hang on to the hydrogen ion very successfully
the reaction is reversible with the great majority of the ammonia at any one time present a free ammonia rather than ammonium ion
the presence of the hydroxide ion from this reaction make the solution alkaline
the corresponding reaction with amine the amine still contains the nitrogen lone pair and doe exactly the same thing
for example with ethylamine you get ethylammonium ion and hydroxide ion produced
there is however a difference in the position of equilibrium
amine are usually stronger base than ammonia
there are exception to this though particularly if the amine group is attached directly to a benzene ring
uk a level syllabus are mostly only concerned with the relative strength of ammonia and the primary amine so that is all you will find on that page

the reaction of amine with copper ii ion just like ammonia amine react with copper ii ion in two separate stage
in the first step we can go on using the theory that a base is a hydrogen ion acceptor
the second stage of the reaction can only be explained in term of the lewis theory that a base is an electron pair donor
the reaction between ammonia and copper ii ion copper ii sulphate solution for example contains the blue hexaaquacopper ii ion
in the first stage of the reaction the ammonia act a a base
with a small amount of ammonia solution hydrogen ion are pulled off two water molecule in the hexaaqua ion
this produce a neutral complex one carrying no charge
if you remove two positively charged hydrogen ion from a ion then obviously there is going to be any charge left on the ion
because of the lack of charge the neutral complex is soluble in water and so you get a pale blue precipitate
this precipitate is often written a cu oh 2 and called copper ii hydroxide
the reaction is reversible because ammonia is only a weak base
that precipitate dissolve if you add an excess of ammonia solution giving a deep blue solution
the ammonia replaces four of the water molecule around the copper to give tetraamminediaquacopper ii ion
the ammonia us it lone pair to form a covalent bond dative covalent bond with the copper
it is acting a an electron pair donor a lewis base
this precipitate is often written a cu oh 2 and called copper ii hydroxide

the ammonia us it lone pair to form a covalent bond dative covalent bond with the copper
it is acting a an electron pair donor a lewis base
explaining why the precipitate redissolves is quite complicated
you will find a lot more explanation about the reaction between hexaaqua ion and ammonia solution in the inorganic section of this site if you are interested
important the inorganic section describes ammonia acting a a ligand in the second stage of the reaction
it is acting a a ligand because it ha a lone pair of electron in other word because it is a lewis base

the colour change are the corresponding reaction with amine the small primary amine behave in exactly the same way a ammonia
there will however be slight difference in the shade of blue that you get during the reaction
taking methylamine a an example with a small amount of methylamine solution you will get a pale blue precipitate of the same neutral complex a with ammonia
all that is happening is that the methylamine is pulling hydrogen ion off the attached water molecule
with more methylamine solution the precipitate redissolves to give a deep blue solution just a in the ammonia case
the amine replaces four of the water molecule around the copper
a the amine get bigger and more bulky the formula of the final product may change simply because it is impossible to fit four large amine molecule and two water molecule around the copper atom
