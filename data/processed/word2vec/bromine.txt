the reaction between phenylamine aniline and bromine water this page look at the reaction of the benzene ring in phenylamine aniline with bromine water
it explains why the amino group activates the ring
activation of the ring the group attached to the benzene ring in phenylamine ha the effect of making the ring much more reactive than it would otherwise be
this is exactly the same a the effect of the group in phenol if you have already come across that
for example phenylamine will react with an aqueous solution of bromine bromine water in the cold and in the absence of any catalyst
unactivated ring will only react with bromine in the presence of a catalyst
the lone pair on the nitrogen touch the delocalised ring electron
and becomes delocalised with them if you follow this link you may have to explore several other page before you are ready to come back here again

a benzene ring undergoes substitution reaction in which the ring electron are attacked by positive ion or the slightly positive part of molecule
in other word it undergoes electrophilic substitution
if you increase the electron density around the ring by involving extra electron from the group it becomes even more attractive to incoming electrophiles
that what happens in phenylamine
if you choose to follow this link or the history file or go menu on your browser to return to this page later
the directing effect of the group the group ha more activating effect on some position around the ring than others for reason which go beyond uk a level
that mean that incoming group will go into some position much faster than they will into others
the net effect of this is that the group ha a effect
that mean that incoming group will tend to go into the position next door to the group or the position opposite the group
you will get hardly any of the isomer formed it is produced too slowly
the reaction with bromine water if bromine water is added to phenylamine the bromine water is decolourised and a white precipitate is formed
this is exactly like the reaction which happens with phenol
the precipitate is
notice the multiple substitution around the ring into all the activated position
the position is of course just the same a the position
both are next door to the group
double bond
the important difference with phenylamine and phenol is the formation of a white precipitate a well a the bromine water being decolourised
since both phenol and phenylamine decolourise bromine water and give a white precipitate how can you distinguish between them
first of course they look entirely different
phenylamine is usually a brownish oil whereas phenol ha white crystal smelling of disinfectant
if you want a simple chemical test test their solubility in sodium hydroxide solution and in dilute hydrochloric acid
phenol is slightly acidic and so reacts with sodium hydroxide solution to give a colourless solution
phenylamine is slightly basic and so reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to give a colourless or pale brown solution
phenol would be no more soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid than it is in water
similarly phenylamine would be no more soluble in sodium hydroxide solution than it is in water
