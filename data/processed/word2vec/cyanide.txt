the nucleophilic substitution reaction between halogenoalkanes and cyanide ion this page give you the fact and simple uncluttered mechanism for the nucleophilic substitution reaction between halogenoalkanes and cyanide ion from for example potassium cyanide
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
important
if you are sure about the difference between primary secondary and tertiary halogenoalkanes it is essential that you follow this link before you go on

the fact if a halogenoalkane is heated under reflux with a solution of sodium or potassium cyanide in ethanol the halogen is replaced by a group and a nitrile is produced
heating under reflux mean heating with a condenser placed vertically in the flask to prevent loss of volatile substance from the mixture
the solvent is important
if water is present you tend to get substitution by instead of
these react with the halogenoalkane
for example using a a typical primary halogenoalkane you could write the full equation rather than the ionic one but it slightly obscures what going on the bromine or other halogen in the halogenoalkane is simply replaced by a group hence a substitution reaction
in this example butanenitrile is formed
in this example there are 4 carbon in the longest chain hence butanenitrile
the mechanism here is the mechanism for the reaction involving bromoethane this is an example of nucleophilic substitution
because the mechanism involves collision between two specie in the slow step in this case the only step of the reaction it is known a an sn2 reaction
sn2 by name you can just call it nucleophilic substitution
if your examiner want you to show the transition state draw the mechanism like this the fact the fact of the reaction are exactly the same a with primary halogenoalkanes
if the halogenoalkane is heated under reflux with a solution of sodium or potassium cyanide in ethanol the halogen is replaced by and a nitrile is produced
for example or if you want the full equation rather than the ionic one the mechanism this mechanism involves an initial ionisation of the halogenoalkane followed by a very rapid attack by the cyanide ion on the carbocation carbonium ion formed this is again an example of nucleophilic substitution
this time the slow step of the reaction only involves one specie the halogenoalkane
it is known a an sn1 reaction
the fact the fact of the reaction are exactly the same a with primary or tertiary halogenoalkanes
the halogenoalkane is heated under reflux with a solution of sodium or potassium cyanide in ethanol
for example the mechanism secondary halogenoalkanes use both sn2 and sn1 mechanism
for example the sn2 mechanism is should you need it the two stage of the sn1 mechanism are
