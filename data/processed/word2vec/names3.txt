the name of aromatic compound this page look at the name of some simple aromatic compound
an aromatic compound is one which contains a benzene ring
it assumes that you are reasonably confident about naming compound containing chain of carbon atom aliphatic compound
naming aromatic compound is quite so straightforward a naming chain compound
often more than one name is acceptable and it not uncommon to find the old name still in use a well
background the benzene ring all aromatic compound are based on benzene c6h6 which ha a ring of six carbon atom and ha the symbol each corner of the hexagon ha a carbon atom with a hydrogen attached
following this link could well take you some time
the phenyl group remember that you get a methyl group ch3 by removing a hydrogen from methane ch4
you get a phenyl group c6h5 by removing a hydrogen from a benzene ring c6h6
like a methyl or an ethyl group a phenyl group is always attached to something else
aromatic compound with only one group attached to the benzene ring case where the name is based on benzene chlorobenzene this is a simple example of a halogen attached to the benzene ring
the name is
the simplified formula for this is c6h5cl
you could therefore although you never do
call it phenyl chloride
whenever you draw a benzene ring with one other thing attached to it you are in fact drawing a phenyl group
in order to attach something else you have to remove one of the existing hydrogen atom and so automatically make a phenyl group
nitrobenzene the nitro group no2 is attached to a benzene ring
the simplified formula for this is c6h5no2
methylbenzene another obvious name the benzene ring ha a methyl group attached
other alkyl would be named similarly for example ethylbenzene
the old name for methylbenzene is toluene and you may still meet that
the simplified formula for this is c6h5ch3
chloromethyl benzene a variant on this which you may need to know about is where one of the hydrogen on the ch3 group is replaced by a chlorine atom
notice the bracket around the chloromethyl in the name
this is so that you are sure that the chlorine is part of the methyl group and not somewhere else on the ring
if more than one of the hydrogen had been replaced by chlorine the name would be dichloromethyl benzene or trichloromethyl benzene
again notice the importance of the bracket in showing that the chlorine are part of the side group and not directly attached to the ring
benzoic acid benzenecarboxylic acid benzoic acid is the older name but is still in common use it a lot easier to say and write than the modern alternative
whatever you call it it ha a carboxylic acid group attached to the benzene ring
case where the name is based on phenyl remember that the phenyl group is a benzene ring minus a hydrogen atom c6h5
if you draw a benzene ring with one group attached you have drawn a phenyl group
phenylamine phenylamine is a primary amine and contains the group attached to a benzene ring
the old name for phenylamine is aniline and you could also reasonably call it aminobenzene
phenylamine is what it is most commonly for exam purpose
refer to your syllabus and recent exam paper
if you are working to a syllabus for 16 18 year old and have got these follow this link to find out how to get hold of them
phenylethene this is an ethene molecule with a phenyl group attached
ethene is a two carbon chain with a double bond
phenylethene is therefore the old name for phenylethene is styrene the monomer from which polystyrene is made
phenylethanone this is a slightly awkward name take it to piece
it consists of a two carbon chain with no double bond
the one ending show that it is a ketone and so ha a group somewhere in the middle
attached to the carbon chain is a phenyl group
putting that together give phenyl ethanoate this is an ester based on ethanoic acid
the hydrogen atom in the group ha been replaced by a phenyl group
phenol ha an group attached to a benzene ring and so ha a formula c6h5oh
aromatic compound with more than one group attached to the benzene ring numbering the ring any group already attached to the ring is given the number 1 position
where you draw it on the ring at the top or in any other position doe matter that just a question of rotating the molecule a bit
it much easier though to get in the habit of drawing your main group at the top
the other ring position are then numbered from 2 to 6
you can number them either clockwise or
a with chain compound you number the ring so that the name you end up with ha the smallest possible number in it
example will make this clear
some simple example substituting chlorine atom on the ring look at these compound all of these are based on methylbenzene and so the methyl group is given the number 1 position on the ring
why is it rather than
the ring is numbered clockwise in this case because that produce a in the name rather than a
2 is smaller than 6
you will find all sort of variation on this depending on the age of the book you look it up in and where it wa published
what i have described above is in strict accordance with the most modern interpretation of the iupac recommendation for naming organic compound
the name should actually be and so on
the substituted group are named in alphabetical order and the 1 position is assigned to the first of these rather than to the more logical methyl group
this produce some silly inconsistency
for example if you had the exactly equivalent compound containing nitro group in place of the chlorine the name would change completely to etc
in this case the normal practice of naming the hydrocarbon first and then attaching other thing to it ha been completely wrecked
do you need to worry about this
no
it is extremely unlikely that you would ever be asked to name these in an exam and it is always easy to write a structure from one of these name however illogical it may be
there is a simple rule for exam purpose
unless you are specifically asked for the name of anything remotely complicated do give it
a long a you have got the structure right that all that matter
acid this might also be called acid
there is a group attached to the ring and because the name is based on benzoic acid that group is assigned the number 1 position
next door to it in the 2 position is a hydroxy group
acid the di show that there are two carboxylic acid group one of them in the 1 position and the other opposite it in the 4 position
this is based on phenol with an group attached in the number 1 position on the ring
there are 3 chlorine atom substituted onto the ring in the 2 4 and 6 position
methyl this is a name you might come across a a part of a practical exercise in nitrating benzene ring
it included partly for that reason and partly because it is a relatively complicated name to finish with
the structure of the name show that it is an ester
you can tell that from the oate ending and the methyl group floating separately from the rest of the name at the beginning
the ester is based on the acid acid so start with that
there will be a benzene ring with a group in the number 1 position and a nitro group no2 in the 3 position
the group is modified to make an ester by replacing the hydrogen of the group by a methyl group
methyl is therefore
