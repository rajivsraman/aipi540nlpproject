the polymerisation of ethene a free radical addition reaction this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the polymerisation of ethene by a free radical addition reaction
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact an addition reaction is one in which two or more molecule join together to give a single product
during the polymerisation of ethene thousand of ethene molecule join together to make poly ethene commonly called polythene
the number of molecule joining up is very variable but is in the region of 2000 to 20000
condition that not strictly true
a catalyst can be recovered unchanged at the end of a reaction but in this case the oxygen is used up
it get incorporated into the polymer molecule a you will see shortly
the mechanism the process is known a free radical addition
chain initiation the chain is initiated by free radical ra produced by reaction between some of the ethene and the oxygen initiator
chain propagation each time a free radical hit an ethene molecule a new longer free radical is formed
etc chain termination eventually two free radical hit each other producing a final molecule
the process stop here because no new free radical are formed
because chain termination is a random process poly ethene will be made up of chain of all sort of different length
