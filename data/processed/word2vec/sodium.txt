reacting alcohol with sodium this page describes the reaction between alcohol and metallic sodium and take a very brief look at the property of the alkoxide which is formed
we will look at the reaction between sodium and ethanol a being typical but you could substitute any other alcohol you wanted to the reaction would be the same
the reaction between sodium and ethanol detail of the reaction if a small piece of sodium is dropped into some ethanol it reacts steadily to give off bubble of hydrogen gas and leaf a colourless solution of sodium ethoxide ch3ch2ona
sodium ethoxide is known a an alkoxide
if the solution is evaporated carefully to dryness the sodium ethoxide is left a a white solid
although at first sight you might think this wa something new and complicated in fact it is exactly the same apart from being a more gentle reaction a the reaction between sodium and water something you have probably known about for year
compare the two we normally of course write the sodium hydroxide formed a naoh rather than hona but that the only difference
sodium ethoxide is just like sodium hydroxide except that the hydrogen ha been replaced by an ethyl group
sodium hydroxide contains ion sodium ethoxide contains ion
if you write it the other way around it doe immediately look a if it come from ethanol
you will find the same thing happens when you write formula for organic salt like sodium ethanoate for example
using the reaction there are two simple us for this reaction to dispose of small amount of sodium safely if you spill some sodium on the bench or have a small amount left over from a reaction you ca just chuck it in the sink
it tends to react explosively with the water and come flying back out at you again
it reacts much more gently with ethanol
ethanol is therefore used to dissolve small quantity of waste sodium
the solution formed can be washed away without problem provided you remember that sodium ethoxide is strongly alkaline see below
to test for the group in alcohol because of the danger involved in handling sodium this is not the best test for an alcohol at this level
because sodium reacts violently with acid to produce a salt and hydrogen you would first have to be sure that the liquid you were testing wa neutral
you would also have to be confident that there wa no trace of water present because sodium reacts with the group in water even better than with the one in an alcohol
with those proviso if you add a tiny piece of sodium to a neutral liquid free of water and get bubble of hydrogen produced then the liquid is an alcohol
some simple reaction of alkoxide ion this is going beyond the demand of uk a level but you might come across the first example a a part of a bit of practical work
the second example is to reinforce the similarity between sodium ethoxide and sodium hydroxide
once again we will take the ethoxide ion in sodium ethoxide a typical
essentially ethoxide and other alkoxide ion behave like hydroxide ion
ethoxide ion are strongly basic if you add water to sodium ethoxide it dissolve to give a colourless solution with a high ph typically ph 14
the solution is strongly alkaline
the reason is that the ethoxide ion remove hydrogen ion from water molecule to produce hydroxide ion
it is these which produce the high ph
ethoxide ion are good nucleophiles a nucleophile is something which carry a negative or partial negative charge which it us to attack positive centre in other molecule or ion
hydroxide ion are good nucleophiles and you may have come across the reaction between a halogenoalkane also called a haloalkane or alkyl halide and sodium hydroxide solution
the hydroxide ion replace the halogen atom
in this case an alcohol is formed
the ethoxide ion behaves in exactly the same way
if you knew the mechanism for the hydroxide ion reaction you could work out exactly what happens in the reaction between a halogenoalkane and ethoxide ion
compare this equation with the last one
the only difference is that where there wa a hydrogen atom at the end of the product molecule you now have an alkyl group
two alkyl or other hydrocarbon group bridged by an oxygen atom is called an ether
this particular one is or ethyl propyl ether
this reaction is a good way of making ether in the lab
for uk a level purpose the problem doe arise you almost certainly wo have to name them
if you have looked at the chemistry of halogenoalkanes you may be aware that there is a competition between substitution and elimination when they react with hydroxide ion
exactly the same competition occurs in their reaction with ethoxide ion
just a the hydroxide ion can act a either a base or a nucleophile exactly the same is true of alkoxide ion like the ethoxide ion
you could read about the reaction of halogenoalkanes with hydroxide ion and work out for yourself what is going to happen in the possible elimination reaction if you used sodium ethoxide rather than sodium hydroxide
because this is getting well beyond uk a level i have given any detail for this anywhere on the site
the whole point about understanding chemistry and especially mechanism
is that you can work thing out for yourself when you need to
