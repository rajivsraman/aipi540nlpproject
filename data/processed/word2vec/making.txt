making halogenoalkanes haloalkane or alkyl halide this page look at way of making halogenoalkanes in the lab starting from alcohol
it cover more than enough detail for uk a level purpose but is intended to be
summarising the method of preparation halogenoalkanes can be made from the reaction between alkene and hydrogen halide but they are more commonly made by replacing the group in an alcohol by a halogen atom
that the method we concentrate on in this page
making halogenoalkanes from alcohol using hydrogen halide the general reaction look like this making chloroalkanes it is possible to make tertiary chloroalkanes successfully from the corresponding alcohol and concentrated hydrochloric acid but to make primary or secondary one you really need to use a different method the reaction rate are too slow
a tertiary chloroalkane can be made by shaking the corresponding alcohol with concentrated hydrochloric acid at room temperature
making bromoalkanes rather than using hydrobromic acid you usually treat the alcohol with a mixture of sodium or potassium bromide and concentrated sulphuric acid
this produce hydrogen bromide which reacts with the alcohol
the mixture is warmed to distil off the bromoalkane
you will find practical detail of a reaction of this kind further down the page
making iodoalkanes in this case the alcohol is reacted with a mixture of sodium or potassium iodide and concentrated phosphoric v acid h3po4 and the iodoalkane is distilled off
the mixture of the iodide and phosphoric v acid produce hydrogen iodide which reacts with the alcohol
phosphoric v acid is used instead of concentrated sulphuric acid because sulphuric acid oxidises iodide ion to iodine and produce hardly any hydrogen iodide
a similar thing happens to some extent with bromide ion in the preparation of bromoalkanes but not enough to get in the way of the main reaction
in the present context all you would need to do is read the beginning of that page

making halogenoalkanes from alcohol using phosphorus halide making chloroalkanes chloroalkanes can be made by reacting an alcohol with liquid phosphorus iii chloride pcl3
they can also be made by adding solid phosphorus v chloride pcl5 to an alcohol
this reaction is violent at room temperature producing cloud of hydrogen chloride gas
it is a good choice a a way of making halogenoalkanes although it is used a a test for group in organic chemistry
there are also side reaction involving the pocl3 reacting with the alcohol
making bromoalkanes and iodoalkanes these are both made in the same general way
instead of using phosphorus iii bromide or iodide the alcohol is heated under reflux with a mixture of red phosphorus and either bromine or iodine
the phosphorus first reacts with the bromine or iodine to give the phosphorus iii halide
these then react with the alcohol to give the corresponding halogenoalkane which can be distilled off
making bromoethane in the lab this is a simple example of an organic preparation and is one of the most commonly used in a level chemistry course
the method described below is not complete
it deliberately avoids mentioning quantity and doe cover any of the safety aspect of the preparation
you can find full detail in most organic practical book
making impure bromoethane concentrated sulphuric acid is added slowly with lot of shaking and cooling to some ethanol in a flask
care ha to be taken because a great deal of heat is produced when the two are mixed and there is a real risk of the ethanol boiling and spraying concentrated sulphuric acid around
solid potassium bromide is then added to the mixture and the flask is connected to a condenser so that the bromoethane formed can be distilled off
bromoethane ha a low boiling point but is denser than water and almost insoluble in it
to prevent it from evaporating it is often collected under water in a flask surrounded by ice
sometimes it is simply collected in a tube surrounded by ice without any water
the reaction flask is heated gently until no more droplet of bromoethane collect
purifying the bromoethane impurity in the bromoethane include hydrogen bromide although most of that will dissolve in the water if you are collecting the bromoethane under water bromine from the oxidation of bromide ion by the concentrated sulphuric acid sulphur dioxide formed when concentrated sulphuric acid oxidises the bromide ion unreacted ethanol ethoxyethane diethyl ether formed by a side reaction between the ethanol and the concentrated sulphuric acid
the purification sequence stage 1 if you have collected the bromoethane under water transfer the content of the collection flask to a separating funnel
otherwise pour the impure bromoethane into the separating funnel add some water and shake it
pour off and keep the bromoethane layer
the water you discard will contain almost all of the hydrogen bromide and quite a lot of any bromine sulphur dioxide and ethanol present a impurity
stage 2 to get rid of any remaining acidic impurity including the bromine and sulphur dioxide return the bromoethane to the separating funnel and shake it with either sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogencarbonate solution
this reacts with any acid present liberating carbon dioxide and forming soluble salt
separate and retain the lower bromoethane layer a before
stage 3 now wash the bromoethane with water in a separating funnel to remove any remaining inorganic impurity excess sodium carbonate solution etc
this time transfer the lower bromoethane layer to a dry test tube
stage 4 add some anhydrous calcium chloride to the tube shake well and leave to stand
the anhydrous calcium chloride is a drying agent and remove any remaining water
it also absorbs ethanol and so any remaining ethanol may be removed a well depending on how much calcium chloride you use
stage 5 transfer the dry bromoethane to a distillation flask and fractionally distil it collecting what distils over at between 35 and
in principle this should remove any remaining organic impurity
in practice though any ethoxyethane which is perhaps the most likely impurity left at this stage ha a boiling point very very close to that of bromoethane
it is unlikely that you will be able to separate the two
if there is any ethanol left which had been absorbed by the calcium chloride that would certainly be removed because it boiling point is much higher
what left
in my experience with a level student virtually nothing if you are working on a small scale
every time you go through a purification stage you inevitably lose some of what you are trying to collect
