the decarboxylation of carboxylic acid and their salt this page look at the formation of hydrocarbon by the decarboxylation of the salt of carboxylic acid and of certain acid themselves by heating them with soda lime
it doe not cover the decarboxylation of some acid by simply heating them
decarboxylation using soda lime what doe decarboxylation mean
a carboxylic acid ha the formula rcooh where r can be hydrogen or a hydrocarbon group such a an alkyl group
the hydrocarbon group could equally well be based on a benzene ring
the sodium salt of a carboxylic acid will have the formula rcoona
in decarboxylation the or group is removed and replaced with a hydrogen atom
what is soda lime
soda lime is manufactured by adding sodium hydroxide solution to solid calcium oxide quicklime
it is essentially a mixture of sodium hydroxide calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide
it come a white granule
in equation it is almost always written a if it were simply sodium hydroxide
it is an easier material to handle than solid sodium hydroxide
solid sodium hydroxide absorbs water from the atmosphere and you tend to end up with puddle of extremely concentrated and corrosive sodium hydroxide solution if you leave it exposed to the air
soda lime ha much less tendency to absorb water
the reaction the solid sodium salt of a carboxylic acid is mixed with solid soda lime and the mixture is heated
for example if you heat sodium ethanoate with soda lime you get methane gas formed this reaction can be done with certain carboxylic acid themselves
for example benzene can be made by heating soda lime with solid benzoic acid benzenecarboxylic acid c6h5cooh
you can think of this a first a reaction between the acid and the soda lime to make sodium benzoate and then a decarboxylation a in the first example
