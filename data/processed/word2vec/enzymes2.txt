the effect of changing condition in enzyme catalysis this page look at the effect of changing substrate concentration temperature and ph on reaction involving enzyme
it follows on from a page describing in simple term how enzyme function a catalyst
please remember that this series of page is written for 16 18 year old chemistry student
if you want something more advanced you are looking in the wrong place
if you have come straight to this page via a search engine you really ought to go back and read that page first
in fact unless you already have a good knowledge of protein structure you may have to go back further still to a page about the structure of protein
the effect of substrate concentration on the rate of reaction remember that in biology or biochemistry the reactant in an enzyme reaction is known a the substrate
what follows is a very brief and simple look at a very complicated topic
anything beyond this is the stuff of biochemistry degree course
a reminder about the effect of concentration on rate in ordinary chemical reaction if you have done any work on rate of reaction especially if you have done order of reaction you will have come across case where the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of a reactant or perhaps to the square of it concentration
you would discover this by changing the concentration of one of the reactant keeping everything else constant and measuring the initial rate of the reaction
if you measure the rate after the reaction ha been going for a while the concentration of the reactant s will have changed and that just complicates thing
that why initial rate are so useful you know exactly how much you have of everything
if you plotted a graph of initial reaction rate against the concentration of a reactant then there are various possibility depending on the relationship between the concentration and the rate
if the rate is independent of the concentration this is called a zero order reaction
if the rate is proportional to the concentration this is called a first order reaction
if the rate is proportional to some power of the concentration greater than one in this case you get a curve
if the rate wa proportional to the square of the concentration that a second order reaction
with reaction controlled by enzyme you get a completely different type of graph
plotting initial rate of reaction against substrate concentration the graph for enzyme controlled reaction look like this two minor thing to notice before we discus it
biochemist talk about a reaction velocity instead of a reaction rate
if you have done any physic you will know that this is a complete misuse of the word velocity
but that what you will find in biochemistry source so that what we will have to use
in chemistry rate are normally measured in term of rate of change of concentration with unit like mol mole per cubic decimetre per second
biochemist often quote it in term of the number of molecule of substrate which a single molecule of enzyme is processing per unit time per second for example
it is easier to visualise but involves a messy calculation to get there
that not our problem for this topic
so why is the graph the shape it is
for very very low substrate concentration the graph is almost a straight line like the second chemistry rate graph above
in other word at very very low concentration the rate is proportional to the substrate concentration
but a concentration increase increasing the concentration more ha less and less effect and eventually the rate reach a maximum
increasing the concentration any more make no difference to the rate of the reaction
if you know about order of reaction the reaction ha now become zero order with respect to the substrate
the reason for this is actually fairly obvious if you think about it
after a certain concentration of substrate is reached every enzyme molecule present in the mixture is working a fast a it can
if you increase the substrate concentration any more there are any enzyme molecule free to help the extra substrate molecule to react
is this unique to reaction
no
it can happen in some ordinary chemistry case a well usually involving a solid catalyst working with gas
at very high gas pressure in other word very high concentration of gas molecule the surface of the catalyst can be completely full of gas molecule
if you increase the amount of gas any more there is any available surface for it to stick to and react
vmax and km the maximum rate for a particular enzyme reaction is known a vmax
that v for velocity a bit confusing for chemist where v is almost always used for volume
this is easily measured by drawing a line on the graph this is sometimes reported a a turnover number measured a the number of molecule of substrate processed by a single enzyme molecule per second or per minute
km is known a the michaelis constant or the constant for reason which need concern u and is a useful measure of the efficiency of an enzyme
km is the concentration of the substrate in mol which produce a reaction rate of half vmax
so it is found like this
a low value of km mean that the reaction is going quickly even at low substrate concentration
a higher value mean the enzyme is a effective
could you just find the concentration of the substrate which produced the maximum rate
if you look at the shape of the graph it would be impossible to get any accurate measure of the concentration which first produced a maximum rate
the curve just gradually get closer and closer to the horizontal and there is no clear point at which it suddenly becomes horizontal
the effect of temperature on the rate of reaction a reminder about the effect of temperature on rate in ordinary chemical reaction remember that for molecule to react they have to collide with an energy equal to or greater than the activation energy for the reaction
heating a reaction make the molecule move faster and so collide more often
more collision in a given time mean a faster reaction
but far more importantly increasing the temperature ha a very big effect on the number of collision with enough energy to react
quite a small temperature rise can produce a large increase in rate
a a reasonable approximation for many although not all reaction close to room temperature a increase in temperature will double the rate of a chemical reaction
this is only an approximation it may take or or whatever but it give you an idea of what to expect
plotting rate of reaction against temperature for low temperature up to about reaction behave much a you would expect any other chemical reaction to behave
but above about the exact temperature varies from enzyme to enzyme there is a dramatic fall in reaction rate
a typical graph of rate against temperature might look like this the temperature at which the rate is fastest is called the optimum temperature for that enzyme
different enzyme have different optimum temperature
some enzyme for example in organism known a thermophiles or extremophiles are capable of working at temperature like or even higher
the optimum temperature for a particular enzyme varies depending on how long it is exposed to the higher temperature
enzyme can withstand temperature higher than their normal optimum if they are only exposed to the higher temperature for a very short time
explaining the rate against temperature graph at lower temperature the shape of the graph is exactly what you would expect for any reaction
all that need explaining is why the rate fall above the optimum temperature
remember that the enzyme work because it substrate fit into the active site on the protein molecule
that active site is produced because of the way the protein is folded into it tertiary structure
heating an enzyme give the protein chain extra energy and make them move more
if they move enough then the bond holding the tertiary structure in place will come under increasing strain
the weaker bond will break first van der waals attraction between side group and then hydrogen bond
a soon a these bond holding the tertiary structure together are broken then the shape of the active site is likely to be lost
obviously the longer the enzyme is held at the higher temperature the more time there is for the enzyme structure to be broken up
given enough time and high enough temperature the enzyme structure is broken permanently
the enzyme is said to be denatured
for example boiling an egg for 5 minute denatures the protein in the egg
once that ha happened you ca it by cooling it
the effect of ph on the rate of reaction in the same way that every enzyme ha an optimum temperature so each enzyme also ha an optimum ph at which it work best
for example trypsin and pepsin are both enzyme in the digestive system which break protein chain in the food into smaller bit either into smaller peptide chain or into individual amino acid
pepsin work in the highly acidic condition of the stomach
it ha an optimum ph of about
on the other hand trypsin work in the small intestine part of which have a ph of around
trypsin optimum ph is about 8
if you think about the structure of an enzyme molecule and the sort of bond that it may form with it substrate it is surprising that ph should matter
suppose an enzyme ha an optimum ph around 7
imagine that at a ph of around 7 a substrate attache itself to the enzyme via two ionic bond
in the diagram below the group allowing ionic bonding are caused by the transfer of a hydrogen ion from a group in the side chain of one amino acid residue to an group in the side chain of another
in this simplified example that is equally true in both the substrate and the enzyme
now think about what happens at a lower ph in other word under acidic condition
it wo affect the group but the will pick up a hydrogen ion
what you will have will be this you no longer have the ability to form ionic bond between the substrate and the enzyme
if those bond were necessary to attach the substrate and activate it in some way then at this lower ph the enzyme wo work
what if you have a ph higher than 7 in other word under alkaline condition
this time the group wo be affected but the group will lose a hydrogen ion
that leaf
again there is no possibility of forming ionic bond and so the enzyme probably wo work this time either
under fairly acidic or alkaline condition all the charge present in the enzyme and substrate would be the same a in the example above
under those circumstance you would be looking at other sort of bonding hydrogen bonding for example perhaps involving hydrogen bond between an ion on one of either the enzyme and substrate and a suitable hydrogen atom or lone pair on the other
the example given is easy to follow
do worry about complication at this level
a long a you can see why changing the ph might affect a simple case that all you need
at extreme ph something more drastic can happen
remember that the tertiary structure of the protein is in part held together by ionic bond just like those we looked at between the enzyme and it substrate
at very high or very low ph these bond within the enzyme can be disrupted and it can lose it shape
if it loses it shape the active site will probably be lost completely
this is essentially the same a denaturing the protein by heating it too much
