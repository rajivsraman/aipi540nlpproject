elimination from unsymmetric halogenoalkanes this page look at elimination from unsymmetric halogenoalkanes such a
is an unsymmetric halogenoalkane in the sense that it ha a ch3 group one side of the bond and a ch2ch3 group the other
you have to be careful with compound like this because of the possibility of more than one elimination product depending on where the hydrogen is removed from
the basic fact and mechanism for these reaction are exactly the same a with simple halogenoalkanes like
this page only deal with the extra problem created by the possibility of more than one elimination product
important
what follow assumes that you are familiar with the mechanism for elimination from
if you are it is essential that you follow this link before you go on
background to the mechanism you will remember that elimination happens when a hydroxide ion from for example sodium hydroxide act a a base and remove a hydrogen a a hydrogen ion from the halogenoalkane
for example in the simple case of elimination from the hydroxide ion remove a hydrogen from one of the carbon atom next door to the bond and the various electron shift then lead to the formation of the alkene in this case propene
with an unsymmetric halogenoalkane like there are several hydrogen which might possibly get removed
you need to think about each of these possibility
where doe the hydrogen get removed from
the hydrogen ha to be removed from a carbon atom adjacent to the bond
if an ion hit one of the hydrogen on the ch3 group in the a we drawn it there nowhere for the reaction to go
to make room for the electron pair to form a double bond between the carbon you would have to expel a hydrogen from the ch2 group a a hydride ion
that is energetically much too difficult and so this reaction doe happen
that still leaf the possibility of removing a hydrogen either from the ch3 or from the ch2 group
if it wa removed from the ch3 group the product is
if it wa removed from the ch2 group this time the product is
in fact the situation is even more complicated than it look because exhibit geometric isomerism
you get a mixture of two isomer formed and
is also known a z is also known a e
for an explanation of the two way of naming these two compound follow the link in the box below
which isomer get formed is just a matter of chance
geometric isomerism isomerism is where you can draw more than one arrangement of the atom for a given molecular formula
geometric isomerism is a special case of this involving molecule which have restricted rotation around one of the bond in this case a double bond
the bond could only rotate if enough energy is put in to break the pi bond
effectively except at high temperature the bond is locked
in the case of the two ch3 group will either both be locked on one side of the to give the ci or z isomer or on opposite side to give the trans or e one

beware
it is easy to miss geometric isomer in an exam
always draw alkene with the correct bond angle around the bond a shown in the diagram for the ci and trans isomer above
if you take a short cut and write a you will almost certainly miss the fact that ci and trans form are possible
this is a rich source of question in an exam
you could easily throw away mark if you miss these possibility
the overall result elimination from lead to a mixture containing also known a z also known a e
