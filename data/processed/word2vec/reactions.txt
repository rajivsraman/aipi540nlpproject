the reaction of aryl halide halogenoarenes this page only look at one aspect of the chemistry of the aryl halide such a chlorobenzene the fact that they are very unreactive compared with halogenoalkanes haloalkane or alkyl halide
this is the only bit of their chemistry asked for by any uk a level syllabus
nucleophilic substitution reaction a nucleophile can be either a negative ion or a molecule which carry a partial negative charge somewhere on it
on this page we are just going to be looking at a simple nucleophile a hydroxide ion
a nucleophilic substitution reaction is one in which a part of a molecule is replaced after it ha been attacked by a nucleophile
follow this link to the introductory page on nucleophilic substitution reaction if you are absolutely confident about this
it would also be worthwhile looking at the page specifically about nucleophilic substitution by hydroxide ion
both of these page deal with nucleophilic substitution in the halogenoalkanes
the rest of this page is going to be a comparison with these reaction and so it is important that you understand them

nucleophilic substitution in the halogenoalkanes here is a quick summary of the two way that halogenoalkanes can react with hydroxide ion
we compare these with the aryl halide afterwards
the two different way in which these reaction can happen depends on what kind of halogenoalkane you are talking about
here is the mechanism for the reaction involving bromoethane a primary halogenoalkane
a hydroxide ion attack the slightly positive carbon atom and push off the bromine a a bromide ion
a tertiary halogenoalkane reacts differently
the mechanism this time involves an initial ionisation of the halogenoalkane
followed by a very rapid attack by the hydroxide ion on the carbocation carbonium ion formed nucleophilic substitution in the aryl halide simple aryl halide like chlorobenzene are very resistant to nucleophilic substitution
it is possible to replace the chlorine by but only under very severe industrial condition for example at and 200 atmosphere
in the lab these reaction do happen
there are two reason for this depending on which of the above mechanism you are talking about
the extra strength of the bond in aryl halide the bond in chlorobenzene is stronger than you might expect
there is an interaction between one of the lone pair on the chlorine atom and the delocalised ring electron and this strengthens the bond
both of the mechanism above involve breaking the bond at some stage
the more difficult it is to break the slower the reaction will be
repulsion by the ring electron this will only apply if the hydroxide ion attacked the chlorobenzene by a mechanism like the first one described above
in that mechanism the hydroxide ion attack the slightly positive carbon that the halogen atom is attached to
if the halogen atom is attached to a benzene ring the incoming hydroxide ion is going to be faced with the delocalised ring electron above and below that carbon atom
the negative hydroxide ion will simply be repelled
that particular mechanism is simply a
