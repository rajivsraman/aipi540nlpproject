esterification of carboxylic acid this page look at esterification the reaction between alcohol and carboxylic acid to make ester
what are ester
ester have a hydrocarbon group of some sort replacing the hydrogen in the group of a carboxylic acid
we shall just be looking at case where it is replaced by an alkyl group but it could equally well be an aryl group one based on a benzene ring
a common ester ethyl ethanoate the most commonly discussed ester is ethyl ethanoate
in this case the hydrogen in the group ha been replaced by an ethyl group
the formula for ethyl ethanoate is notice that the ester is named the opposite way around from the way the formula is written
the ethanoate bit come from ethanoic acid
the ethyl bit come from the ethyl group on the end
take time and care to make sure you understand
a few more ester in each case be sure that you can see how the name and formula relate to each other
remember that the acid is named by counting up the total number of carbon atom in the chain including the one in the group
so for example ch3ch2cooh is propanoic acid and ch3ch2coo is the propanoate group
making ester the chemistry of the reaction the esterification reaction is both slow and reversible
the equation for the reaction between an acid rcooh and an alcohol where r and r can be the same or different is so for example if you were making ethyl ethanoate from ethanoic acid and ethanol the equation would be it is not required for any uk a level chemistry syllabus

doing the reaction on a test tube scale carboxylic acid and alcohol are often warmed together in the presence of a few drop of concentrated sulphuric acid in order to observe the smell of the ester formed
you would normally use small quantity of everything heated in a test tube stood in a hot water bath for a couple of minute
because the reaction are slow and reversible you do get a lot of ester produced in this time
the smell is often masked or distorted by the smell of the carboxylic acid
a simple way of detecting the smell of the ester is to pour the mixture into some water in a small beaker
ester are virtually insoluble in water and tend to form a thin layer on the surface
excess acid and alcohol both dissolve and are tucked safely away under the ester layer
small ester like ethyl ethanoate smell like typical organic solvent ethyl ethanoate is a common solvent in for example glue
a the ester get bigger the smell tend towards artificial fruit flavouring pear drop for example
on a larger scale if you want to make a reasonably large sample of an ester the method used depends to some extent on the size of the ester
small ester are formed faster than bigger one
to make a small ester like ethyl ethanoate you can gently heat a mixture of ethanoic acid and ethanol in the presence of concentrated sulphuric acid and distil off the ester a soon a it is formed
this prevents the reverse reaction happening
it work well because the ester ha the lowest boiling point of anything present
the ester is the only thing in the mixture which doe form hydrogen bond and so it ha the weakest intermolecular force
larger ester tend to form more slowly
in these case it may be necessary to heat the reaction mixture under reflux for some time to produce an equilibrium mixture
the ester can be separated from the carboxylic acid alcohol water and sulphuric acid in the mixture by fractional distillation
