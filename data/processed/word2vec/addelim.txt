reaction of aldehyde and ketone this page look at the reaction of aldehyde and ketone with brady reagent a a test for the double bond
it also look briefly at some other similar reaction which are all known a or condensation reaction
the reaction with is often abbreviated to or
a solution of in a mixture of methanol and sulphuric acid is known a brady reagent
what is
although the name sound complicated and the structure look quite complicated it is actually very easy to work out
start with the formula of hydrazine
that almost all you need to remember
hydrazine is in phenylhydrazine one of the hydrogen is replaced by a phenyl group c6h5
this is based on a benzene ring
if you are familiar with this there is a carbon atom at each corner of the hexagon together with a hydrogen atom if there is anything else attached
the circle in the middle of the hexagon suggests the delocalised electron
if you want to read more about the structure of benzene you could follow this link to another part of the site
it is important for the purpose of the present page and you might have to explore quite a lot of other page to help you to understand that one
if you do choose to follow this link or history file or go menu if you get seriously waylaid on your browser to return to this page
in there are two nitro group no2 attached to the phenyl group in the and position
the corner with the nitrogen attached is counted a the number 1 position and you just number clockwise around the ring
doing the reaction detail vary slightly depending on the nature of the aldehyde or ketone and the solvent that the is dissolved in
assuming you are using brady reagent a solution of the in methanol and sulphuric acid add either a few drop of the aldehyde or ketone or possibly a solution of the aldehyde or ketone in methanol to the brady reagent
a bright orange or yellow precipitate show the presence of the double bond in an aldehyde or ketone
this is the simplest test for an aldehyde or ketone
the chemistry of the reaction the overall reaction is given by the equation r and r can be any combination of hydrogen or hydrocarbon group such a alkyl group
if at least one of them is a hydrogen then the original compound is an aldehyde
if both are hydrocarbon group then it is a ketone
look carefully at what ha happened
provided you take care to draw the two starting molecule lined up right working out the structure of the product is easy
the product is known a a
notice that all that ha changed is the ending from to
that possibly confusing
the product from the reaction with ethanal would be called ethanal from propanone you would get propanone and so on
that not too difficult
the reaction is known a a condensation reaction
a condensation reaction is one in which two molecule join together with the loss of a small molecule in the process
in this case that small molecule is water
in term of mechanism this is a nucleophilic reaction
the first add across the double bond the addition stage to give an intermediate compound which then loses a molecule of water the elimination stage
uk a level syllabus and so you wo find it anywhere on this site
sorry
using the reaction the reaction ha two us in testing for aldehyde and ketone
first you can just use it to test for the presence of the double bond
you only get an orange or yellow precipitate from a double bond in an aldehyde or ketone
secondly you can use it to help to identify the specific aldehyde or ketone
the precipitate is filtered and washed with for example methanol and then recrystallised from a suitable solvent which will vary depending on the nature of the aldehyde or ketone
for example you can recrystallise the product from the small aldehyde and ketone from a mixture of ethanol and water
the crystal are dissolved in the minimum quantity of hot solvent
when the solution cool the crystal are and can be filtered washed with a small amount of solvent and dried
they should then be pure
if you then find the melting point of the crystal you can compare it with table of the melting point of of all the common aldehyde and ketone to find out which one you are likely to have got
some other similar reaction if you go back and look at the equation nothing in the change during the reaction apart from the group
you can get a similar reaction if the group is attached to other thing
in each case the reaction would look like this in what follows all that change is the nature of the x
with hydrazine the product is a hydrazone
if you started from propanone it would be propanone hydrazone
with phenylhydrazine the product is a phenylhydrazone
with hydroxylamine the product is an oxime for example ethanal oxime
