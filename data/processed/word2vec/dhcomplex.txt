dehydration of more complicated alcohol this page build on your understanding of the acid catalysed dehydration of alcohol
you have to be wary with more complicated alcohol in case there is the possibility of more than one alkene being formed
is a good example of this with no less than three different alkene being formed when it is dehydrated
is just an example to illustrate the problem
it is important that you understand it so that you can work out what will happen in similar case
it would be quite impossible for you to learn what happens with every single alcohol you might be presented with
the basic fact and mechanism for these reaction are exactly the same a with
this page only deal with the extra problem created by the possibility of more than one dehydration product
important
what follow assumes that you are familiar with the mechanism for the dehydration of
if you are it is essential that you follow this link before you go on
background to make the diagram less cluttered we use the simplified version of the mechanism showing gain and loss of
remember that the mechanism take place in three stage the alcohol is protonated by the acid catalyst
the alcohol is protonated by the acid catalyst
the protonated alcohol loses a water molecule to give a carbocation carbonium ion
the carbocation formed loses a hydrogen ion and form a double bond
so in the case of the dehydration of the dehydration of the first two stage there is nothing new at all in these stage
in the first stage the alcohol is protonated by picking up a hydrogen ion from the sulphuric acid
in the second stage the positive ion then shed a water molecule and produce a carbocation
the complication arises in the next step
when the carbocation loses a hydrogen ion where is it going to come from
where doe the hydrogen get removed from
so that a double bond can form it will have to come from one of the carbon next door to the one with the positive charge
if a hydrogen ion is lost from the ch3 group if a hydrogen ion is lost from the ch2 group this time the product is
in fact the situation is even more complicated than it look because exhibit geometric isomerism
you get a mixture of two isomer formed and
is also known a z is also known a e
for an explanation of the two way of naming these two compound follow the link in the box below
geometric isomerism isomerism is where you can draw more than one arrangement of the atom for a given molecular formula
geometric isomerism is a special case of this involving molecule which have restricted rotation around one of the bond in this case a double bond
the bond could only rotate if enough energy is put in to break the pi bond
effectively except at high temperature the bond is locked
in the case of the two ch3 group will either both be locked on one side of the to give the ci or z isomer or on opposite side to give the trans or e one

beware
it is easy to miss geometric isomer in an exam
always draw alkene with the correct bond angle around the bond a shown in the diagram for the ci and trans isomer above
if you take a short cut and write a you will almost certainly miss the fact that ci and trans form are possible
this is a rich source of question in an exam
you could easily throw away mark if you miss these possibility
the overall result dehydration of lead to a mixture containing also known a z also known a e
