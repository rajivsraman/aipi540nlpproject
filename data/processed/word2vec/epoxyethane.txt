epoxyethane ethylene oxide this page look at the manufacture of epoxyethane from ethene and then at some of the product that are made from epoxyethane
the manufacture of epoxyethane ethene is reacted with with oxygen under these condition problem and hazard during manufacture the main problem come in controlling the temperature
the reaction is exothermic and so the temperature will tend to rise unless it is carefully controlled
at higher temperature the ethene burn in the oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water which mean that the temperature would increase even more and the whole thing get completely out of hand
two hazard during manufacture come from the nature of epoxyethane
it is poisonous and carcinogenic cancer producing highly flammable or explosive in contact with air
the reactivity of epoxyethane ring strain the reason that epoxyethane is so reactive is that bonding pair in the ring of atom in the molecule are forced very close together
the bond angle are about rather than about when carbon atom normally form single bond
the overlap between the atomic orbitals in forming the and bond is less good than it is normally and there is considerable repulsion between the bonding pair
the system becomes more stable if the ring is broken
when epoxyethane reacts a bond is always broken and the ring open up
us of epoxyethane manufacture of ethylene glycol acid catalysed hydrolysis of epoxyethane epoxyethane reacts with water in the presence of an acid catalyst very dilute sulphuric acid at a temperature of about
is produced
a large excess of water is used to try to prevent the product from reacting with the original epoxyethane
is an alcohol because it contains simple group and alcohol react with epoxyethane see below
even in the presence of a large excess of water this reaction happens a well the product is still an alcohol and similar reaction can also lead to quite long chain
us of is used a an antifreeze in car engine
it is added to the cooling water to prevent it from freezing under very cold condition
is also used in the manufacture of polyester such a poly ethylene terephthalate
you may have come across this a a fibre used to make clothes perhaps under the brand name terylene or a a clear material used to make plastic drink bottle pet
the reaction of epoxyethane with alcohol this is a reaction which student at this level often find difficulty remembering
it is actually probably easier to work out than remember
think of it a an extension of the reaction with water
alcohol have the formula where r is an alkyl group
water can be thought of a
the reaction of epoxyethane with water can be like this now do the same thing with the alcohol product molecule of this type are used a solvent
notice that the product is still an alcohol
it ha an group at the end of the molecule
if the epoxyethane is in excess the reaction can continue
in fact it continues to some extent even if the epoxyethane is in excess
the product from this reaction is again an alcohol and can go on to react with even more epoxyethane
what you get eventually is a chain with a structure compound of this type are used a plasticiser added for example to pvc to make it more flexible or a surfactant detergent
to make the surfactant you would start with a fairly long chain alcohol to produce a molecule such a
