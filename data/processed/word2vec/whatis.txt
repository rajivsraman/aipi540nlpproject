electrophilic addition electrophilic addition happens in many of the reaction of compound containing double bond the alkene
the structure of ethene we are going to start by looking at ethene because it is the simplest molecule containing a double bond
what is true of in ethene will be equally true of in more complicated alkene
ethene c2h4 is often modelled a shown on the right
the double bond between the carbon atom is of course two pair of shared electron
what the diagram doe show is that the two pair are the same a each other
one of the pair of electron is held on the line between the two carbon nucleus a you would expect but the other is held in a molecular orbital above and below the plane of the molecule
a molecular orbital is a region of space within the molecule where there is a high probability of finding a particular pair of electron
in this diagram the line between the two carbon atom represents a normal bond the pair of shared electron lie in a molecular orbital on the line between the two nucleus where you would expect them to be
this sort of bond is called a sigma bond
the other pair of electron is found somewhere in the shaded part above and below the plane of the molecule
this bond is called a pi bond
the electron in the pi bond are free to move around anywhere in this shaded region and can move freely from one half to the other
the dotted line to two of the hydrogen show bond going back into the screen or paper away from you
the wedge shape show bond coming out towards you
the pi electron are not a fully under the control of the carbon nucleus a the electron in the sigma bond and because they lie exposed above and below the rest of the molecule they are relatively open to attack by other thing

electrophiles an electrophile is something which is attracted to region in other molecule or ion
because it is attracted to a negative region an electrophile must be something which carry either a full positive charge or ha a slight positive charge on it somewhere
for example a francophile is someone who like the french an anglophile is someone who like the english
ethene and the other alkene are attacked by electrophiles
the electrophile is normally the slightly positive end of a molecule like hydrogen bromide hbr
electrophiles are strongly attracted to the exposed electron in the pi bond and reaction happen because of that initial attraction a you will see shortly
you might wonder why fully positive ion like sodium do react with ethene
although these ion may well be attracted to the pi bond there is no possibility of the process going any further to form bond between sodium and carbon because sodium form ionic bond whereas carbon normally form covalent one
addition reaction in a sense the pi bond is an unnecessary bond
the structure would hold together perfectly well with a single bond rather than a double bond
the pi bond often break and the electron in it are used to join other atom or group of atom onto the ethene molecule
in other word ethene undergoes addition reaction
for example using a general molecule
summary electrophilic addition reaction an electrophilic addition reaction is an addition reaction which happens because what we think of a the important molecule is attacked by an electrophile
the important molecule ha a region of high electron density which is attacked by something carrying some degree of positive charge
because ethene is the molecule we are focusing on we quite arbitrarily think of it a the central molecule and hydrogen bromide a it attacker
there no real justification for this of course apart from the fact that it help to put thing in some sort of logical pattern
in reality the molecule just collide and may react if they have enough energy and if they are lined up correctly
understanding the electrophilic addition mechanism the mechanism for the reaction between ethene and a molecule it is very unlikely that any two different atom joined together will have the same electronegativity
we are going to assume that y is more electronegative than x so that the pair of electron is pulled slightly towards the y end of the bond
that mean that the x atom carry a slight positive charge
the slightly positive x atom is an electrophile and is attracted to the exposed pi bond in the ethene
now imagine what happens a they approach each other
you are now much more likely to find the electron in the half of the pi bond nearest the xy
a the process continues the two electron in the pi bond move even further towards the x until a covalent bond is made
the electron in the bond are pushed entirely onto the y to give a negative ion

why doe the carbon atom have a positive charge
the pi bond wa originally made using an electron from each carbon atom but both of these electron have now been used to make a bond to the x atom
this leaf the carbon atom an electron short hence positively charged
note also that we are only showing one of the pair of electron around the ion
there will be other lone pair a well but we are only actually interested in the one we drawn
important term an ion in which the positive charge is carried on a carbon atom is called a carbocation or a carbonium ion an older term
in the final stage of the reaction the electron in the lone pair on the ion are strongly attracted towards the positive carbon atom
they move towards it and form a dative covalent bond between the y and the carbon
help
a dative covalent bond is simply a covalent bond in which both shared electron originate from the same atom
the bond formed between the x and the other carbon atom wa also a bond
once a bond ha been formed there is no difference whatsoever between it and any other covalent bond
how to write this mechanism in an exam the movement of the various electron pair are shown using curly arrow
help
if you are sure about the use of curly arrow in mechanism you must follow this link before you go on
