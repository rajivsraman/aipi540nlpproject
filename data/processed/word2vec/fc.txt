reaction of benzene and methylbenzene this page give detail of the reaction of benzene and methylbenzene toluene
the mechanism for some of these reaction are covered elsewhere on the site and you will find link to those a you go along
acylation acylation of benzene what is acylation
an acyl group is an alkyl group attached to a double bond
if r represents any alkyl group then an acyl group ha the formula
acylation mean substituting an acyl group into something in this case into a benzene ring
the most commonly used acyl group is
this is called the ethanoyl group and in this case the reaction is sometimes called ethanoylation
in the example which follows we are substituting a group into the ring but you could equally well use any other acyl group
the fact the most reactive substance containing an acyl group is an acyl chloride also known a an acid chloride
these have the general formula rcocl
benzene is treated with a mixture of ethanoyl chloride ch3cocl and aluminium chloride a the catalyst
the mixture is heated to about for about 30 minute
a ketone called phenylethanone old name acetophenone is formed
you may find slight variation on the condition for this reaction
various recipe i have found vary the temperature and time for example by having a slightly lower temperature for a longer time
or if you want a more compact form the aluminium chloride is written into these equation because it is acting a a catalyst
if you wanted to include it you could write alcl3 over the top of the arrow see below
acylation of methylbenzene toluene the reaction is just the same with methylbenzene except that you have to worry about where the acyl group attache to the ring relative to the methyl group
normally the methyl group in methylbenzene directs new group into the and position assuming the methyl group is in the position
in acylation though virtually all the substitution happens in the position
uk a level
the reason that you get virtually none of the isomer in this instance is because of the size of the incoming acyl group
everything get too cluttered and therefore less stable if you try to put the acyl group next door to the methyl group
alkylation alkylation of benzene what is alkylation
alkylation mean substituting an alkyl group into something in this case into a benzene ring
a hydrogen on the ring is replaced by a group like methyl or ethyl and so on
the fact benzene reacts at room temperature with a chloroalkane for example chloromethane or chloroethane in the presence of aluminium chloride a a catalyst
on this page we will look at substituting a methyl group but any other alkyl group could be used in the same way
substituting a methyl group give methylbenzene
or you get further methyl group substituted around the ring
you can improve your chance of just getting monosubstitution by using a large excess of benzene
you wo have to worry about this for uk a level purpose
you will find the mechanism for this reaction in the mechanism section of this site

alkylation of methylbenzene toluene again the reaction is just the same with methylbenzene except that you have to worry about where the alkyl group attache to the ring relative to the methyl group
unfortunately this time there is a problem
where the incoming alkyl group end up depends to a large extent on the temperature of the reaction
at substituting methyl group into methylbenzene you get a mixture of the and isomer in the proportion 54 17 29
that a higher proportion of the isomer than you might expect
at the proportion change to 3 69 28
in other word the proportion of the isomer ha increased even more
raise the temperature some more and the trend continues
the reason for this is again beyond uk a level
you can get equilibrium set up between the various isomer
the reason for the directing effect of the methyl group in methylbenzene lie in the fact that the and isomer form faster than the isomer
however in this case the isomer is the most thermodynamically stable of the three
if you raise the temperature or allow more time the equilibrium set up favour the most stable product
you do not have to worry about this for a level purpose
alkylation industrially the manufacture of ethylbenzene ethylbenzene is an important industrial chemical used to make styrene phenylethene which in turn is used to make polystyrene poly phenylethene
it is manufactured from benzene and ethene
there are several way of doing this some of which use a variation on alkylation
the reaction is done in the liquid state
ethene is passed through a liquid mixture of benzene aluminium chloride and a catalyst promoter which might be chloroethane or hydrogen chloride
we are going to assume it is hcl
promoter are used to make catalyst work better
there are two variant on the process
one the union carbide badger process us a temperature no higher than and a pressure just high enough to keep everything liquid
the other the monsanto process us a slightly higher temperature of which need less catalyst
presumably although i have been able to confirm this the pressure would also need to be higher to keep everything liquid at the higher temperature
or again the aluminium chloride and hcl are written into these equation because they are acting a catalyst
if you wanted to include them you could write alcl3 and hcl over the top of the arrow
this will show exactly what the hcl and aluminium chloride are doing in the reaction
