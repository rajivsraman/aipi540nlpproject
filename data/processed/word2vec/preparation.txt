making phenylamine this page look in outline at the preparation of phenylamine also known a aniline or aminobenzene starting from benzene
the benzene is first converted to nitrobenzene which is in turn reduced to phenylamine
benzene to nitrobenzene benzene is nitrated by replacing one of the hydrogen atom on the benzene ring by a nitro group no2
the benzene is treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid at a temperature not exceeding
the mixture is held at this temperature for about half an hour
yellow oily nitrobenzene is formed
you could write this in a more condensed form a the concentrated sulphuric acid is acting a a catalyst and so is written into the equation
the temperature is kept relatively low to prevent more than one nitro group being substituted onto the ring

nitrobenzene to phenylamine the conversion is done in two main stage stage 1 conversion of nitrobenzene into phenylammonium ion nitrobenzene is reduced to phenylammonium ion using a mixture of tin and concentrated hydrochloric acid
the mixture is heated under reflux in a boiling water bath for about half an hour
under the acidic condition rather than getting phenylamine directly you instead get phenylammonium ion formed
the lone pair on the nitrogen in the phenylamine pick up a hydrogen ion from the acid
the for this reaction is the nitrobenzene ha been reduced by gaining electron in the presence of the acid
the electron come from the tin which form both tin ii and tin iv ion
combining them into full equation lead you to some really scary equation where it is difficult to see what is going on
the problem is made much worse because the tin ion formed go on to react with chloride ion from the hydrochloric acid to form complex ion such a
if you are sure about you could follow this link but it really is important for uk a level purpose to worry too much about this in the present context
you are unlikely to need much more than the condition for the reaction

stage 2 conversion of the phenylammonium ion into phenylamine all you need to do is to remove the hydrogen ion from the group
sodium hydroxide solution is added to the product of the first stage of the reaction
the phenylamine is formed together with a complicated mixture of tin compound from reaction between the sodium hydroxide solution and the complex tin ion formed during the first stage
the phenylamine is finally separated from this mixture
the separation is long tedious and potentially dangerous involving steam distillation solvent extraction and a final distillation
i not going to make any attempt to describe this in detail
if you want detail refer to any good practical organic chemistry textbook
summary what you are likely to need for uk a level chemistry purpose can be summed up by you are almost bound to need the mechanism for the nitration reaction a well
