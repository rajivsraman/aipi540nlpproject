the question you should find the question if you have understood what you have read
i have tried to write clever or especially searching question which might lower your confidence if you ca do them
any question which might need a little bit more thought will be fully explained in the answer
it is important to realise that the question are not designed to look like those in any particular exam system
they are just a simple check that will tell you whether or not you ought to look again at the page s you have just read
the answer i have given very full answer in most case because i want to use them to reinforce the important point
in an exam you may not have enough space to write a much a i have done
but this is about giving you exam answer it is about making sure that you understand
when you write your answer write them in enough detail so that a reasonably intelligent friend with a similar background to you could understand them
the best way of being absolutely sure that you understand something is to try to teach it to somebody else
worry about producing exam answer later on when you are sure that your understanding is good
should i use these question for revision purpose
no you should
the question are designed to help the learning process and at revision time you need something entirely different
to be honest if you have got the basic understanding in place by then which is what these question are designed to help then it is too late
you ca the whole course in a couple of week and expect to succeed
the best revision you can do is to work from past paper mark scheme and examiner report if they are available so that you can practise and learn exactly what your examiner want
if you have left it late to start this then you probably wo have time to actually do all the question but reading them together with the mark scheme will give you a good idea of exactly what you need to know and how you should present it to your examiner
revision is a time to what you already know and understand and make sure that it exactly match what your examiner want
