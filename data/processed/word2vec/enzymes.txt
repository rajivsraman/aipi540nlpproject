protein a enzyme this page is an introduction to how protein can work a enzyme biological catalyst
you should realise that this is written to cover the need of a number of chemistry syllabus for 16 18 year old
if you want detailed knowledge about enzyme for a biology or biochemistry course you are probably in the wrong place
this is just an introduction
if you do have a reasonable knowledge of the structure of protein and the sort of attraction that can be found in them you may not understand bit of the present page
read the protein structure page first and come back here later
important the specific example of the enzyme that you will find on this page are only intended to give you a feel for the way that enzyme work
unless your syllabus specifically asks for a particular enzyme there is no need for you to remember the detail
enzyme a catalyst enzyme are mainly globular protein protein molecule where the tertiary structure ha given the molecule a generally rounded ball shape although perhaps a very squashed ball in some case
the other type of protein fibrous protein have long thin structure and are found in tissue like muscle and hair
we are interested in those in this topic
these globular protein can be amazingly active catalyst
you are probably familiar with the use of catalyst like manganese iv oxide in decomposing hydrogen peroxide to give oxygen and water
the enzyme catalase will also do this but at a spectacular rate compared with inorganic catalyst
one molecule of catalase can decompose almost a hundred thousand molecule of hydrogen peroxide every second
that very impressive
this is a model of catalase showing the globular structure a bit like a tangled mass of string rcsb protein data bank
you should be able to identify the and sheet
if you ca you obviously did read the page about protein structure mentioned above
if you look very carefully you might also spot two pink structure hidden in the main structure
more about these in a while
an important point about enzyme is that they are very specific about what they can catalyse
even small change in the reactant molecule can stop the enzyme from catalysing it reaction
the reason for this lie in the active site present in the enzyme
active site active site are crack or hollow on the surface of the enzyme caused by the way the protein fold itself up into it tertiary structure
molecule of just the right shape and with just the right arrangement of attractive group see later can fit into these active site
other molecule wo fit or wo have the right group to bind to the surface of the active site
the usual analogy for this is a key fitting into a lock
for the key to work properly it ha to fit exactly into the lock
in chemistry we would describe the molecule which is actually going to react the purple one in the diagram a the reactant
in biology and biochemistry the reactant in an enzyme reaction is known instead a the substrate
you must take this picture of the way a substrate fit into it enzyme too literally
what is just a important a the physical shape of the substrate are the bond which it can form with the enzyme
enzyme are protein molecule long chain of amino acid residue
remember that sticking out all along those chain are the side group of the amino acid the r group that we talked about on the page about protein structure
active site of course have these r group lining them a well typically from about 3 to 12 in an active site
the next diagram show an imaginary active site remember that these r group contain the sort of feature which are responsible for the tertiary structure in protein
for example they may contain ionic group like or or group which can hydrogen bond or hydrocarbon chain or ring which can contribute to van der waals force
group like these help a substrate to attach to the active site but only if the substrate molecule ha an arrangement of group in the right place to interact with those on the enzyme
the diagram show a possible set of interaction involving two ionic bond and a hydrogen bond
the group shown with or sign are obvious
the one with the h s in them are group capable of hydrogen bonding
it is possible that one or more of the unused r group in the active site could also be helping with van der waals attraction between them and the substrate
if the arrangement of the group on the active site or the substrate wa even slightly different the bonding almost certainly would be a good and in that sense a different substrate would fit the active site on the enzyme
this process of the catalyst reacting with the substrate and eventually forming product is often summarised a
where e is the enzyme s the substrate and p the product
the formation of the complex is reversible the substrate could obviously just break away again before it converted into product
the second stage is shown a but might be reversible in some case
it would depend on the energetics of the reaction
so why doe attaching itself to an enzyme increase the rate at which the substrate convert into product
it is at all obvious why that should be and most source providing information at this introductory level just gloss over it or talk about it in vague general term which is what i am going to be forced to do because i ca find a simple example to talk about
catalyst in general and enzyme are no exception work by providing the reaction with a route with a lower activation energy
attaching the substrate to the active site must allow electron movement which end up in bond breaking much more easily than if the enzyme wa there
strangely it is much easier to see what might be happening in other case where the situation is a bit more complicated
enzyme cofactor what we have said so far is a major for most enzyme
most enzyme are in fact just pure protein molecule
other bit and piece are needed to make them work
these are known a cofactor
in the absence of the right cofactor the enzyme doe work
for those of you who like collecting obscure word the inactive protein molecule is known a an apoenzyme
when the cofactor is in place so that it becomes an active enzyme it is called a holoenzyme
you must take this picture of the way a substrate fit into it enzyme too literally

when the cofactor is in place so that it becomes an active enzyme it is called a holoenzyme
neither of them occurs in the syllabus i am trying to cover with this material
i have spent a lifetime in chemistry education without having come across either of them until researching this
there are two basically different sort of cofactor
some are bound tightly to the protein molecule so that they become a part of the enzyme these are called prosthetic group
some are entirely free of the enzyme and attach themselves to the active site alongside the substrate these are called coenzyme
prosthetic group prosthetic group can be a simple a a single metal ion bound into the enzyme structure or may be a more complicated organic molecule which might also contain a metal ion
the enzyme carbonic anhydrase and catalase are simple example of the two type
zinc ion in carbonic anhydrase carbonic anhydrase is an enzyme which catalysis the conversion of carbon dioxide into hydrogencarbonate ion or the reverse in the cell
if you look this up elsewhere you will find that biochemist tend to persist in calling hydrogencarbonate by it old name bicarbonate
in fact there are a whole family of carbonic anhydrases all based around different protein but all of them have a zinc ion bound up in the active site
in this case the mechanism is well understood and simple
we look at this in some detail because it is a good illustration of how enzyme work
important this is just an example
if you are doing a chemistry syllabus for 16 18 year old there is almost certainly no need to learn this
if in doubt check your syllabus
if it doe explicitly ask for this reaction in detail you do need to learn it
to repeat i just using it to illustrate how enzyme carry out a simple reaction
the zinc ion is bound to the protein chain via three link to separate histidine residue in the chain shown in pink in the picture of one version of carbonic anhydrase
the zinc is also attached to an group shown in the picture using red for the oxygen and white for the hydrogen
wikipedia
i have no reason to doubt it accuracy but i ca guarantee it
a far a i have been able to find out all the various form of carbonic anhydrase have the zinc ion bound to three histidine residue in this way irrespective of what is happening in the rest of the protein molecule
if i am wrong about this generalisation could you please let me know via the address on the about this site page
the structure of the amino acid histidine is
and when it is a part of a protein chain it is joined up like this if you look at the model of the arrangement around the zinc ion in the picture above you should at least be able to pick out the ring part of the three molecule
the zinc ion is bound to these histidine ring via dative covalent covalent bond from lone pair on the nitrogen atom
simplifying the structure around the zinc
the arrangement of the four group around the zinc is approximately tetrahedral
notice that i have distorted the usual roughly tetrahedral arrangement of electron pair around the oxygen that just to keep the diagram a clear a possible
so that the structure around the zinc
how doe this catalyse the reaction between carbon dioxide and water
a carbon dioxide molecule is held by a nearby part of the active site so that one of the lone pair on the oxygen is pointing straight at the carbon atom in the middle of the carbon dioxide molecule
attaching it to the enzyme also increase the existing polarity of the bond
if you have done any work on organic reaction mechanism at all then it is pretty obvious what is going to happen
the lone pair form a bond with the carbon atom and part of one of the bond break and leaf the oxygen atom with a negative charge on it
what you now have is a hydrogencarbonate ion attached to the zinc
the next diagram show this broken away and replaced with a water molecule from the cell solution
all that now need to happen to get the catalyst back to where it started is for the water to lose a hydrogen ion
this is transferred by another water molecule to a nearby amino acid residue with a nitrogen in the r group and eventually by a series of similar transfer out of the active site completely
and the carbonic anhydrase enzyme can do this sequence of reaction about a million time a second
this is a wonderful piece of molecular machinery
let me repeat yet again if you are doing a chemistry exam for 16 18 year old you are unlikely to need detail of this reaction
i talked it through in some detail to show that although enzyme are complicated molecule all they do is some basic chemistry
it is just that this particular example is a lot easier to understand than most
the haem u heme group in catalase remember the model of catalase from further up the page
at the time i mentioned the group which this contains shown in pink in the picture
these are haem u heme group bound to the protein molecule and an essential part of the working of the catalase
the haem group is a good example of a prosthetic group
if it wa there the protein molecule would work a a catalyst
the haem group contain an iron iii ion bound into a ring molecule one of a number of related molecule called porphyrin
the iron is locked into the centre of the porphyrin molecule via dative covalent bond from four nitrogen atom in the ring structure
there are various type of porphyrin so there are various different haem group
the one we are interested in is called haem b and a model of the haem b group with the iron iii ion in grey at the centre look like this wikipedia and you will also find a proper structure for the group on the page you will get to by following this link if you are interested and a lot more information that you probably wo want to know about
you may have come across haemoglobin in the transport of oxygen around the blood
this is the same haem group that is at the heart of that with one small difference
in haemoglobin the iron is present a iron ii rather than iron iii
the reaction that catalase carry out is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into water and oxygen
a lot of work ha been done on the mechanism for this reaction but i am only going to give you a simplified version rather than describe it in full
although it look fairly simple on the surface there are a lot of hidden thing going on to complicate it
essentially the reaction happens in two stage and involves the iron changing it oxidation state
an easy change of oxidation state is one of the main characteristic of transition metal
in the lab iron commonly ha two oxidation state a well a zero in the metal itself and and change readily from one to the other
in catalase the change is from to the far less common and back again
in the first stage there is a reaction between a hydrogen peroxide molecule and the active site to give the enzyme in the equation refers to everything haem group and protein apart from the iron ion
the iii and iv are the oxidation state of the iron in both case
this equation and the next one are not proper chemical equation
they are just summary of the most obvious thing which have happened
the new arrangement around the iron then reacts with a second hydrogen peroxide to regenerate the original structure and produce oxygen and a second molecule of water
what is hidden away in this simplification are the other thing that are happening at the same time for example the rest of the haem group and some of the amino acid residue around the active site are also changed during each stage of the reaction
and if you think about what ha to happen to the hydrogen peroxide molecule in both reaction it ha to be more complicated than this suggests
hydrogen peroxide is joined up a and yet both hydrogen end up attached to the same oxygen
that is quite a complicated thing to arrange in small step in a mechanism and involves hydrogen ion being transferred via amino acid residue in the active site
so do you need to remember all this for chemistry purpose at this level
no not unless your syllabus specifically asks you for it
it is basically just an illustration of the term prosthetic group
it also show that even in a biochemical situation transition metal behave in the same sort of way a they do in inorganic chemistry they form complex and they change their oxidation state
and if you want to follow this up to look in detail at what is happening you will find the same sort of interaction around the active site that we looked at in the simpler case of carbonic anydrase
but please do waste time on this unless you have to it is seriously complicated
coenzyme coenzyme are another form of cofactor
they are different from prosthetic group in that they are permanently attached to the protein molecule
instead coenzyme attach themselves to the active site alongside the substrate and the reaction involves both of them
once they have reacted they both leave the active site both changed in some way
a simple diagram showing a substrate and coenzyme together in the active site might look like this it is much easier to understand this with a relatively simple example
a coenzyme with alcohol dehydrogenase alcohol dehydrogenase is an enzyme which start the process by which alcohol ethanol in the blood is oxidised to harmless product
the name dehydrogenase suggests that it is oxidising the ethanol by removing hydrogen from it
the reaction is actually between ethanol and the coenzyme attached to the active site of the protein molecule
is a commonly used coenzyme in all sort of redox reaction in the cell
stand for nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
the plus sign which is a part of it name is because it carry a positive charge on a nitrogen atom in the structure
the nicotinamide part of the structure come from the vitamin variously called vitamin b3 niacin or nicotinic acid
several important coenzyme are derived from vitamin
or even nicotinic acid this page is already long enough
if you are interested they are easy to find via a google search
in common with what i have done on the rest of this page this is just an example to illustrate how a coenzyme work which is reasonably easy to understand
you are unlikely to need detail for any chemistry exam at this level
ethanol is oxidised by a reaction with helped by the active site of the enzyme
at the end of the reaction ethanal acetaldehyde is formed and the ha been converted into another compound known a nadh
a far a the is concerned it ha picked up a hydrogen atom together with an extra electron which ha neutralised the charge
both major product ethanal and nadh leave the active site and are processed further in other cell reaction
the very poisonous ethanal is oxidised at once to ethanoic acid using a different enzyme but again using a the coenzyme
and the ethanoic acid from that reacts on through a whole set of further reaction to eventually end up a carbon dioxide and water
what about the nadh
this is a coenzyme in it own right and take part in reaction where something need reducing
the hydrogen atom and the extra electron that it picked up from the ethanol are given to something else
in the process of course the nadh get oxidised back to again
in general term for a substrate s which need reducing and one final time do you need to remember any of this
no unless this particular example is on your syllabus
you will find the link to the first of these below
what follows is a page about the effect of substrate concentration temperature and ph on enzyme and then a further page about enzyme inhibitor
