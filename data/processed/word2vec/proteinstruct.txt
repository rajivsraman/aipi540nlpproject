the structure of protein this page explains how amino acid combine to make protein and what is meant by the primary secondary and tertiary structure of protein
quaternary structure is covered
it only applies to protein consisting of more than one polypeptide chain
there is a mention of quaternary structure on the ib chemistry syllabus but on no other syllabus at this level
i do know exactly what depth the ib syllabus want for this which is why i have included it
i suspect what is wanted is fairly trivial
ib student should ask the advice of their teacher or lecturer
the primary structure of protein drawing the amino acid in chemistry if you were to draw the structure of a general acid you would probably draw it like this however for drawing the structure of protein we usually twist it so that the r group stick out at the side
it is much easier to see what is happening if you do that
that mean that the two simplest amino acid glycine and alanine would be shown a peptide and polypeptide glycine and alanine can combine together with the elimination of a molecule of water to produce a dipeptide
it is possible for this to happen in one of two different way so you might get two different dipeptides
either or in each case the linkage shown in blue in the structure of the dipeptide is known a a peptide link
in chemistry this would also be known a an amide link but since we are now in the realm of biochemistry and biology we use their term
if you joined three amino acid together you would get a tripeptide
if you joined lot and lot together a in a protein chain you get a polypeptide
a protein chain will have somewhere in the range of 50 to 2000 amino acid residue
you have to use this term because strictly speaking a peptide chain is made up of amino acid
when the amino acid combine together a water molecule is lost
the peptide chain is made up from what is left after the water is lost in other word is made up of amino acid residue
by convention when you are drawing peptide chain the group which ha been converted into a peptide link is written at the end
the unchanged group is written at the end
the end of the peptide chain with the group is known a the and the end with the group is the
a protein chain with the on the left will therefore look like this the r group come from the 20 amino acid which occur in protein
the peptide chain is known a the backbone and the r group are known a side chain
in this case the hydrogen on the nitrogen nearest the r group is missing and the r group loop around and is attached to that nitrogen a well a to the carbon atom in the chain
i mention this for the sake of completeness not because you would be expected to know about it in chemistry at this introductory level
the primary structure of protein now there a problem
the term primary structure is used in two different way
at it simplest the term is used to describe the order of the amino acid joined together to make the protein
in other word if you replaced the r group in the last diagram by real group you would have the primary structure of a particular protein
this primary structure is usually shown using abbreviation for the amino acid residue
these abbreviation commonly consist of three letter or one letter
using three letter abbreviation a bit of a protein chain might be represented by for example if you look carefully you will spot the abbreviation for glycine gly and alanine ala amongst the others
if you followed the protein chain all the way to it end you would find an amino acid residue with an unattached group
the is always written on the left of a diagram for a protein primary structure whether you draw it in full or use these abbreviation
the wider definition of primary structure includes all the feature of a protein which are a result of covalent bond
obviously all the peptide link are made of covalent bond so that is a problem
but there is an additional feature in protein which is also covalently bound
it involves the amino acid cysteine
if two cysteine side chain end up next to each other because of folding in the peptide chain they can react to form a sulphur bridge
this is another covalent link and so some people count it a a part of the primary structure of the protein
because of the way sulphur bridge affect the way the protein fold other people count this a a part of the tertiary structure see below
this is obviously a potential source of confusion
important you need to know where your particular examiner are going to include sulphur bridge a a part of the primary structure or a a part of the tertiary structure
you need to check your current syllabus and past paper
if you are studying a syllabus and have got these follow this link to find out how to get hold of them
the secondary structure of protein within the long protein chain there are region in which the chain are organised into regular structure known a and sheet
these are the secondary structure in protein
these secondary structure are held together by hydrogen bond
these form a shown in the diagram between one of the lone pair on an oxygen atom and the hydrogen attached to a nitrogen atom although the hydrogen bond are always between and group the exact pattern of them is different in an and a sheet
when you get to them below take some time to make sure you see how the two different arrangement work
important if you are happy about hydrogen bonding and are unsure about what this diagram mean follow this link before you go on
what follows is difficult enough to visualise anyway without having to worry about what hydrogen bond are a well
you must also find out exactly how much detail you need to know about this next bit
it may well be that all you need is to have heard of an and know that it is held together by hydrogen bond between the and group
once again you need to check your syllabus and past paper particularly mark scheme for the past paper
if you follow either of these link on your browser to return to this page
the in an the protein chain is coiled like a spring
the alpha mean that if you look down the length of the spring the coiling is happening in a clockwise direction a it go away from you
a bit of computer lead would do
in truth if you are a chemistry student you are very unlikely to need to know this
if protein secondary structure is on your syllabus your examiner are most likely only to want you to know how the structure are held together by hydrogen bonding
check past paper to be sure
if you are reading this a a biochemistry or biology student and have been given some other way of recognising an stick to whatever method you have been given
the next diagram show how the is held together by hydrogen bond
this is a very simplified diagram missing out lot of atom
we talk it through in some detail after you have had a look at it
what wrong with the diagram
two thing first of all only the atom on the part of the coil facing you are shown
if you try to show all the atom the whole thing get so complicated that it is virtually impossible to understand what is going on
secondly i have made no attempt whatsoever to get the bond angle right
i have deliberately drawn all of the bond in the backbone of the chain a if they lie along the spiral
in truth they stick out all over the place
again if you draw it properly it is virtually impossible to see the spiral
so what do you need to notice
notice that all the r group are sticking out sideways from the main helix
notice the regular arrangement of the hydrogen bond
all the group are pointing upwards and all the group pointing downwards
each of them is involved in a hydrogen bond
and finally although you ca see it from this incomplete diagram each complete turn of the spiral ha approximately amino acid residue in it
if you had a whole number of amino acid residue per turn each group would have an identical group underneath it on the turn below
hydrogen bonding ca happen under those circumstance
each turn ha 3 complete amino acid residue and two atom from the next one
that mean that each turn is offset from the one above and below such that the and group are brought into line with each other
sheet in a sheet the chain are folded so that they lie alongside each other
the next diagram show what is known a an sheet
all that mean is that chain are heading in opposite direction
given the way this particular folding happens that would seem to be inevitable
it is in fact inevitable
it is possible to have some much more complicated folding so that chain are actually heading in the same direction
we are getting well beyond the demand of uk a level chemistry and it equivalent now
the folded chain are again held together by hydrogen bond involving exactly the same group a in the
that wa an arbitrary choice which produced a diagram which fitted nicely on the screen
the tertiary structure of protein what is tertiary structure
the tertiary structure of a protein is a description of the way the whole chain including the secondary structure fold itself into it final shape
this is often simplified into model like the following one for the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase
enzyme are of course based on protein
rcsb protein data bank
if you want to find more information about dihydrofolate reductase their reference number for it is 7dfr
there is nothing particularly special about this enzyme in term of structure
i chose it because it contained only a single protein chain and had example of both type of secondary structure in it
the model show the in the secondary structure a coil of ribbon
the sheet are shown a flat bit of ribbon ending in an arrow head
the bit of the protein chain which are just random coil and loop are shown a bit of string
the colour coding in the model help you to track your way around the structure going through the spectrum from dark blue to end up at red
you will also notice that this particular model ha two other molecule locked into it shown a ordinary molecular model
these are the two molecule whose reaction this enzyme catalysis
what hold a protein into it tertiary structure
the tertiary structure of a protein is held together by interaction between the the side chain the r group
there are several way this can happen
ionic interaction some amino acid such a aspartic acid and glutamic acid contain an extra group
some amino acid such a lysine contain an extra group
you can get a transfer of a hydrogen ion from the to the group to form zwitterions just a in simple amino acid
you could obviously get an ionic bond between the negative and the positive group if the chain folded in such a way that they were close to each other
hydrogen bond notice that we are now talking about hydrogen bond between side group not between group actually in the backbone of the chain
lot of amino acid contain group in the side chain which have a hydrogen atom attached to either an oxygen or a nitrogen atom
this is a classic situation where hydrogen bonding can occur
for example the amino acid serine contains an group in the side chain
you could have a hydrogen bond set up between two serine residue in different part of a folded chain
you could easily imagine similar hydrogen bonding involving group or group or group or group in various combination although you would have to be careful to remember that a group and an group would form a zwitterion and produce stronger ionic bonding instead of hydrogen bond
van der waals dispersion force several amino acid have quite large hydrocarbon group in their side chain
a few example are shown below
temporary fluctuating dipole in one of these group could induce opposite dipole in another group on a nearby folded chain
the dispersion force set up would be enough to hold the folded structure together
