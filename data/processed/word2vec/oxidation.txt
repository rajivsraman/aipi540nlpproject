oxidation of aldehyde and ketone this page look at way of distinguishing between aldehyde and ketone using oxidising agent such a acidified potassium dichromate vi solution tollens reagent fehling solution and benedict solution
background why do aldehyde and ketone behave differently
you will remember that the difference between an aldehyde and a ketone is the presence of a hydrogen atom attached to the double bond in the aldehyde
ketone do have that hydrogen
the presence of that hydrogen atom make aldehyde very easy to oxidise
or put another way they are strong reducing agent
alternatively come back to this link if you feel you need help later on in this page
or history file or go menu if you get seriously waylaid on your browser to return to this page
because ketone do have that particular hydrogen atom they are resistant to oxidation
only very strong oxidising agent like potassium manganate vii solution potassium permanganate solution oxidise ketone and they do it in a destructive way breaking bond
provided you avoid using these powerful oxidising agent you can easily tell the difference between an aldehyde and a ketone
aldehyde are easily oxidised by all sort of different oxidising agent ketone are
you will find detail of these reaction further down the page
what is formed when aldehyde are oxidised
it depends on whether the reaction is done under acidic or alkaline condition
under acidic condition the aldehyde is oxidised to a carboxylic acid
under alkaline condition this could form because it would react with the alkali
a salt is formed instead
hcho the oxidation go further
the methanoic acid or methanoate ion formed are easily oxidised to carbon dioxide and water
building equation for the oxidation reaction if you need to work out the equation for these reaction the only reliable way of building them is to use
the for the oxidation of the aldehyde obviously varies depending on whether you are doing the reaction under acidic or alkaline condition
under acidic condition it is
and under alkaline condition there is any real need to remember them
follow this link if you are sure how to do it or if you are confident about using these equation
these particular example are covered but the technique is exactly the same whatever the equation
because i am going to be using quite a lot on the rest of this page it would definitely be worth following this link if you are happy about them

these are then combined with the from whatever oxidising agent you are using
example are given in detail below
specific example in each of the following example we are assuming that you know that you have either an aldehyde or a ketone
there are lot of other thing which could also give positive result
assuming that you know it ha to be one or the other in each case a ketone doe nothing
only an aldehyde give a positive result
using acidified potassium dichromate vi solution a small amount of potassium dichromate vi solution is acidified with dilute sulphuric acid and a few drop of the aldehyde or ketone are added
if nothing happens in the cold the mixture is warmed gently for a couple of minute for example in a beaker of hot water
the orange dichromate vi ion have been reduced to green chromium iii ion by the aldehyde
in turn the aldehyde is oxidised to the corresponding carboxylic acid
the for the reduction of dichromate vi ion is combining that with the for the oxidation of an aldehyde under acidic condition
give the overall equation i have gone to all the trouble of working out a complete equation for this reaction and the next one rather than using symbol like which are frequently used in organic chemistry
the problem is that what is important in using these reaction a test is the colour change in the oxidising agent
in this particular reaction you have to explain for example why the solution turn green
any equation that you write ha got to show the production of the chromium iii ion
if you are sure exactly how the two are combined to give the final equation follow the last link further up the page to learn how to do it and then come back and have a go yourself to check that you can get the right answer
using tollens reagent the silver mirror test tollens reagent contains the diamminesilver i ion
this is made from silver i nitrate solution
you add a drop of sodium hydroxide solution to give a precipitate of silver i oxide and then add just enough dilute ammonia solution to redissolve the precipitate
to carry out the test you add a few drop of the aldehyde or ketone to the freshly prepared reagent and warm gently in a hot water bath for a few minute
aldehyde reduce the diamminesilver i ion to metallic silver
because the solution is alkaline the aldehyde itself is oxidised to a salt of the corresponding carboxylic acid
whether you get a silver mirror or not seems a matter of luck
i have watched really careful student clean everything scrupulously and take great care over quantity and still get no more than a trace of a mirror
on the other hand student who have just thrown everything together in the first grubby test tube that came to hand can get a wonderful mirror
life is always fair
the for the reduction of the diamminesilver i ion to silver is combining that with the for the oxidation of an aldehyde under alkaline condition
give the overall equation using fehling solution or benedict solution fehling solution and benedict solution are variant of essentially the same thing
both contain complexed copper ii ion in an alkaline solution
fehling solution contains copper ii ion complexed with tartrate ion in sodium hydroxide solution
complexing the copper ii ion with tartrate ion prevents precipitation of copper ii hydroxide
benedict solution contains copper ii ion complexed with citrate ion in sodium carbonate solution
again complexing the copper ii ion prevents the formation of a precipitate this time of copper ii carbonate
both solution are used in the same way
a few drop of the aldehyde or ketone are added to the reagent and the mixture is warmed gently in a hot water bath for a few minute
aldehyde reduce the complexed copper ii ion to copper i oxide
because the solution is alkaline the aldehyde itself is oxidised to a salt of the corresponding carboxylic acid
fehling solution over many year
getting the dark red precipitate described in all the book wa actually pretty rare
a lot of imagination had to go in to spotting the red colour in amongst all the other colour you tend to get a well
it wa one of my favourite test
i have never used benedict solution perhaps that behaves better
methanal is such a powerful reducing agent that the copper ii ion may be reduced to metallic copper often seen a a very nice copper mirror on the tube
the equation for these reaction are always simplified to avoid having to write in the formula for the tartrate or citrate ion in the copper complex
the for both fehling solution and benedict solution can be written a combining that with the for the oxidation of an aldehyde under alkaline condition
give the overall equation benedict solution which is made alkaline using sodium carbonate
sodium carbonate solution is alkaline because the carbonate ion react reversibly with water to produce hydroxide ion and hydrogencarbonate ion
