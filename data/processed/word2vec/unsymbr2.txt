the reaction between unsymmetrical alkene and bromine important
this page assumes that you have already read the page on the addition of bromine to symmetrical alkene
if you have you must read it before you go on
it contains important advice that you will need to make best use of this page
this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic addition reaction between bromine and alkene like propene
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
an unsymmetrical alkene is one like propene in which the group or atom attached to either end of the double bond are different
for example in propene there are a hydrogen and a methyl group at one end but two hydrogen atom at the other end of the double bond
is another unsymmetrical alkene
the fact in common with all other alkene propene reacts in the cold with pure liquid bromine or with a solution of bromine in an organic solvent like tetrachloromethane
the double bond break and a bromine atom becomes attached to each carbon
the bromine loses it original colour to give a colourless liquid
in the case of the reaction with propene is formed
the other halogen apart from fluorine behave similarly
fluorine reacts explosively with all hydrocarbon including alkene to give carbon and hydrogen fluoride
if you are interested in the reaction with say chlorine all you have to do is to replace br by cl in all the equation on this page
the mechanism for the reaction between propene and bromine the reaction is an example of electrophilic addition
just a with symmetrical alkene there are two version of the propene bromine mechanism in common use and you must know which your examiner will accept
how you can find out which one your examiner expect is explained on the page on the addition of bromine to symmetrical alkene
bromine a an electrophile the bromine is a very polarisable molecule and the approaching pi bond in the propene induces a dipole in the bromine molecule
if you draw this mechanism in an exam write the word induced dipole next to the bromine molecule
the simplified version of the mechanism the more accurate version of the mechanism there no point in making life difficult for yourself
in the first stage of the reaction one of the bromine atom becomes attached to both carbon atom with the positive charge being found on the bromine atom
a bromonium ion is formed
the bromonium ion is then attacked from the back by a bromide ion formed in a nearby reaction
