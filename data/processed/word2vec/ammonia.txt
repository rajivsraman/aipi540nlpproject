nucleophilic addition elimination in the reaction between acyl chloride and ammonia this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the nucleophilic addition elimination reaction between acyl chloride acid chloride and ammonia
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
ethanoyl chloride is taken a a typical acyl chloride
any other acyl chloride will behave in the same way
simply replace the ch3 group in what follows by anything else you want
the fact ethanoyl chloride reacts violently with a cold concentrated solution of ammonia
a white solid product is formed which is a mixture of ethanamide an amide and ammonium chloride
notice that unlike the reaction between ethanoyl chloride and water or ethanol hydrogen chloride is produced at least not in any quantity
any hydrogen chloride formed would immediately react with excess ammonia to give ammonium chloride
the mechanism the first stage the addition stage of the reaction involves a nucleophilic attack on the fairly positive carbon atom by the lone pair on the nitrogen atom in the ammonia
the second stage the elimination stage happens in two step
in the first the double bond reform and a chloride ion is pushed off
that is followed by removal of a hydrogen ion from the nitrogen
this might happen in one of two way it might be removed by a chloride ion producing hcl which would immediately react with excess ammonia to give ammonium chloride a above
and
or it might be removed directly by an ammonia molecule
the ammonium ion together with the chloride ion already there make up the ammonium chloride formed in the reaction
