the reaction between methane and bromine this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the free radical substitution reaction between methane and bromine
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact this reaction between methane and bromine happens in the presence of ultraviolet light typically sunlight
this is a good example of a photochemical reaction a reaction brought about by light
it is better to use the term photochemical and keep the word catalysis for reaction speeded up by actual substance rather than light
the organic product is bromomethane
one of the hydrogen atom in the methane ha been replaced by a bromine atom so this is a substitution reaction
however the reaction doe stop there and all the hydrogen in the methane can in turn be replaced by bromine atom
multiple substitution is dealt with on a separate page and you will find a link to that at the bottom of this page
check your syllabus at this point
if your syllabus want you to know about the free radical substitution reaction between methane and chlorine a well a this one do waste time trying to learn both mechanism
the two mechanism are identical
you just need to learn one of them
if you are asked for the other one all you need to do is to write bromine say instead of chlorine
in writing the bromine mechanism on these page that exactly what i done
if you read both chlorine and bromine version you find them boringly repetitive
the mechanism the mechanism involves a chain reaction
during a chain reaction for every reactive specie you start off with a new one is generated at the end and this keep the process going
specie a useful word which is used in chemistry to mean any sort of particle you want it to mean
it cover molecule ion atom or in this case free radical
the process is known a free radical substitution or a a free radical chain reaction
what is free radical substitution

chain initiation the chain is initiated started by uv light breaking a bromine molecule into free radical
chain propagation reaction these are the reaction which keep the chain going
chain termination reaction these are reaction which remove free radical from the system without replacing them by new one
