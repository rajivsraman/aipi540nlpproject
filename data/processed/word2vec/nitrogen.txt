the reaction of acid anhydride with ammonia and primary amine this page look at the reaction of acid anhydride with ammonia and with primary amine
these reaction are considered together because their chemistry is so similar
there is also a great similarity between acid anhydride and acyl chloride acid chloride a far a these reaction are concerned
concentrate on these similarity a you go through this page because it should help you to remember
similarity between the reaction comparing the structure of ammonia and primary amine each substance contains an group
in ammonia this is attached to a hydrogen atom
in a primary amine it is attached to an alkyl group shown by r in the diagram below or a benzene ring
it is likely to take you some time though and you may have to visit several other page a well
it is particularly important in the context of the current page
all you need to know is that at each corner of the hexagon there is a carbon atom together with a hydrogen atom apart from where the group is attached

comparing the reaction of acyl chloride and acid anhydride with these compound because the formula is much easier it help to start with the acyl chloride
the reaction with acyl chloride we take ethanoyl chloride a typical of the acyl chloride
taking a general case of a reaction between ethanoyl chloride and a compound xnh2 where x is hydrogen or an alkyl group or a benzene ring
the reaction happens in two stage first so
in each case you initially get hydrogen chloride gas the hydrogen coming from the group and the chlorine from the ethanoyl chloride
everything left over just get joined together
but ammonia and amine are basic and react with the hydrogen chloride to produce a salt
so the second stage of the reaction is the same reaction with acid anhydride ethanoic anhydride is the only one you are likely to come across for uk a level purpose
again the reaction happens in two stage
in the first if you compare this with the acyl chloride equation you can see that the only difference is that ethanoic acid is produced a the second product of the reaction rather than hydrogen chloride
you can think of the entire bit of the ethanoic anhydride shown in red a being exactly the equivalent of the chlorine atom in the acyl chloride a far a these reaction are concerned
then the ethanoic acid reacts with excess ammonia or amine to give a salt this time an ethanoate
this look more difficult than the acyl chloride case because of the way the salt is written
you get an ethanoate ion and a positive ion with this structure this is easier to understand with real compound a you will see below
in summary these reaction are just the same a the corresponding acyl chloride reaction except initially ethanoic acid is formed a the second product rather than hydrogen chloride gas
the second stage of the reaction involves the formation of an ethanoate rather than a chloride
the reaction are slower
acid anhydride are so violently reactive a acyl chloride and the reaction normally need heating
the individual reaction the reaction with ammonia in this case the x in the equation above is a hydrogen atom
so in the first instance you get ethanoic acid and an organic compound called an amide
amide contain the group
in the reaction between ethanoic anhydride and ammonia the amide formed is called ethanamide
this is more usually and more easily
written a the ethanoic acid produced reacts with excess ammonia to give ammonium ethanoate
and you can combine all this together to give one overall equation you need to follow this through really carefully because the two product of the reaction overall can look confusingly similar
the corresponding reaction with an acyl chloride is i have moved the position of the positive charge in the ammonium ion in this equation compared with the previous one
in each case i have placed it a close a possible to the negative charge in the ethanoate ion or chloride ion
in the ethanoate case that make it easier to draw the structure of the similar positive ion in the amine equation below
the reaction with primary amine the reaction with methylamine we take methylamine a typical of primary amine where the is attached to an alkyl group
the initial equation would be the first product this time is called an amide
if you compare the structure with the amide produced in the reaction with ammonia the only difference is that one of the hydrogen on the nitrogen ha been substituted for a methyl group
this particular compound is
the n simply show that the substitution is on the nitrogen atom and not elsewhere in the molecule
the equation would normally be written you can think of primary amine a just being modified ammonia
if ammonia is basic and form a salt with the ethanoic acid excess methylamine will do exactly the same thing
the salt is called methylammonium ethanoate
it is just like ammonium ethanoate except that one of the hydrogen ha been replaced by a methyl group
you would usually combine these equation into one overall equation for the reaction the corresponding reaction with an acyl chloride is the reaction with phenylamine aniline phenylamine is the simplest primary amine where the group is attached directly to a benzene ring
it old name is aniline
in phenylamine there is anything else attached to the ring a well
you can write the formula of phenylamine a c6h5nh2
there is no essential difference between this reaction and the reaction with methylamine but i just want to look at the structure of the amide formed
the overall equation for the reaction is the product are and phenylammonium ethanoate
this reaction can sometimes look even more
confusing if the phenylamine is drawn showing the benzene ring and especially if the reaction is looked at from the point of view of the phenylamine
for example the product molecule might be drawn looking like this if you stop and think about it this is obviously the same molecule a in the equation above but it stress the phenylamine part of it much more
looking at it this way notice that one of the hydrogen of the group ha been replaced by an acyl group an alkyl group attached to a double bond
you can say that the phenylamine ha been acylated or ha undergone acylation
because of the nature of this particular acyl group it is also described a ethanoylation
the hydrogen is being replaced by an ethanoyl group
uk a level purpose this is probably the most likely context that you will meet this particular reaction in
you would need to know that phenylamine reacted with ethanoic anhydride to produce an amide and that this wa an example of acylation or ethanoylation
you would probably be expected to draw the structure but would be pretty unlucky if you had to write equation a above
i have taught a lot of very clever people in my time but there are many where i would have confidence that they could produce those equation under exam condition
