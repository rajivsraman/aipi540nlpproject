the reaction of acid anhydride with water alcohol and phenol this page look at the reaction of acid anhydride with water alcohol and phenol including the manufacture of aspirin
these reaction are all considered together because their chemistry is so similar
there is also a great similarity between acid anhydride and acyl chloride acid chloride a far a these reaction are concerned
concentrate on these similarity a you go through this page because it should help you to remember
similarity between the reaction comparing the structure of water ethanol and phenol each substance contains an group
in water this is attached to a hydrogen atom
in an alcohol it is attached to an alkyl group shown in the diagram below a r
in phenol it is attached to a benzene ring
phenol the simplest member of the family of phenol is c6h5oh
it is likely to take you some time though and you may have to visit several other page a well
it is particularly important in the context of the current page
all you need to know is that at each corner of the hexagon there is a carbon atom together with a hydrogen atom apart from where the group is attached

comparing the reaction of acyl chloride and acid anhydride with these compound because the formula is much easier it help to start with the acyl chloride
the reaction with acyl chloride we take ethanoyl chloride a typical of the acyl chloride
taking a general case of a reaction between ethanoyl chloride and a compound where x is hydrogen or an alkyl group or a benzene ring so
in each case hydrogen chloride gas is produced the hydrogen coming from the group and the chlorine from the ethanoyl chloride
everything left over just get joined together
the same reaction with acid anhydride ethanoic anhydride is the only one you are likely to come across for uk a level purpose
if you compare this with the acyl chloride equation you can see that the only difference is that ethanoic acid is produced a the second product of the reaction rather than hydrogen chloride
you can think of the entire bit of the ethanoic anhydride shown in red a being exactly the equivalent of the chlorine atom in the acyl chloride a far a these reaction are concerned
these reaction are just the same a the corresponding acyl chloride reaction except ethanoic acid is formed a the second product rather than hydrogen chloride gas
the reaction are slower
acid anhydride are so violently reactive a acyl chloride
the individual reaction the reaction with water modifying the general equation we just looked at you will see that you just get two molecule of ethanoic acid produced
this is more usually and more easily
written a the reaction happens slowly at room temperature faster on gentle warming without a great deal exciting to observe unlike in the acyl chloride case where hydrogen chloride fume are produced
you mix two colourless liquid and get another colourless liquid
the equivalent acyl chloride reaction is the reaction with alcohol we start by taking the general case of any alcohol reacting with ethanoic anhydride
the equation would be or more simply the product this time apart from the ethanoic acid always produced is an ester
for example with ethanol you would get the ester ethyl ethanoate this reaction also need gentle heating for it to happen at a reasonable rate and again there is anything visually dramatic
the equivalent acyl chloride reaction is carboxylic acid like ethanoic acid react with alcohol to give ester so why doe this happen with the acid molecule that is formed reacting with alcohol in the mixture
the reason is simply one of reaction condition
this reaction is happening in the absence of any catalyst
to get carboxylic acid and alcohol to react at any sort of reasonable rate you need heat and a catalyst such a concentrated sulphuric acid
the reaction with phenol the reaction with phenol itself phenol have an group attached directly to a benzene ring
in the substance normally called phenol there is anything else attached to the ring a well
we look at that first
the reaction between phenol and ethanoic anhydride is particularly important but you would get an ester just a you do with an alcohol
or more simply especially if you write the equation in this second way it is obvious that you have just produced another ester in this case called phenyl ethanoate
the equivalent acyl chloride reaction is but beware
you may come across the structure of the ester drawn in a variety of other way which make it look much more a if it wa a derivative of phenol which of course it is
for example looking at it this way notice that the hydrogen of the phenol group ha been replaced by an acyl group an alkyl group attached to a double bond
you can say that the phenol ha been acylated or ha undergone acylation
because of the nature of this particular acyl group it is also described a ethanoylation
the hydrogen is being replaced by an ethanoyl group
using a similar reaction to make aspirin the reaction with phenol itself is very important but you can make aspirin by a very similar reaction
the molecule below is acid also known a acid
the old name for this is salicylic acid
you might find it written in either of these two way
they are the same structure with the molecule just flipped over in space
you might also find it with the group at the top and the group next door and either to the left or right of it
life can get very confusing
when this reacts with ethanoic anhydride it is ethanoylated or acylated if you want to use the more general term to give you might find all sort of other variant on drawing this a well
this molecule is aspirin
although this reaction can also be done with ethanoyl chloride aspirin is manufactured by reacting acid with ethanoic anhydride at
the reason for using ethanoic anhydride rather than ethanoyl chloride include ethanoic anhydride is cheaper than ethanoyl chloride
ethanoic anhydride is safer to use than ethanoyl chloride
it is less corrosive and not so readily hydrolysed it reaction with water is slower
ethanoic anhydride doe produce dangerous corrosive and poisonous fume of hydrogen chloride
