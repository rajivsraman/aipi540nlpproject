the elimination reaction producing alkene from simple halogenoalkanes this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the elimination reaction between a simple halogenoalkane like and hydroxide ion from for example sodium hydroxide to give an alkene like propene
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
you will also find a link to a page on elimination from more complicated halogenoalkanes where more than one product may be formed
exam question on this topic frequently ask about another possibility in the reaction between halogenoalkanes and hydroxide ion nucleophilic substitution
there is also a link to a page discussing this
you will probably find that the question centre around secondary halogenoalkanes like because these can easily be persuaded to do either reaction
that why this page deal exclusively with
the fact is heated under reflux with a concentrated solution of sodium or potassium hydroxide in ethanol
heating under reflux involves heating with a condenser placed vertically in the flask to avoid loss of volatile liquid
propene is formed and because this is a gas it pass through the condenser and can be collected
everything else present including anything formed in the alternative substitution reaction will be trapped in the flask
the mechanism in elimination reaction the hydroxide ion act a a base removing a hydrogen a a hydrogen ion from the carbon atom next door to the one holding the bromine
the resulting of the electron expels the bromine a a bromide ion and produce propene
