polyester this page look at the formation structure and us of a common polyester sometimes known a terylene if it is used a a fibre or pet if it used in for example plastic drink bottle
poly ethylene terephthalate what is a polyester
a polyester is a polymer a chain of repeating unit where the individual unit are held together by ester linkage
the diagram show a very small bit of the polymer chain and look pretty complicated
but it is very difficult to work out and that the best thing to do work it out not try to remember it
you will see how to do that in a moment
the usual name of this common polyester is poly ethylene terephthalate
the everyday name depends on whether it is being used a a fibre or a a material for making thing like bottle for soft drink
when it is being used a a fibre to make clothes it is often just called polyester
it may sometimes be known by a brand name like terylene
when it is being used to make bottle for example it is usually called pet
making polyester a an example of condensation polymerisation in condensation polymerisation when the monomer join together a small molecule get lost
that different from addition polymerisation which produce polymer like poly ethene in that case nothing is lost when the monomer join together
a polyester is made by a reaction involving an acid with two group and an alcohol with two group
in the common polyester drawn above the acid is acid old name terephthalic acid
the alcohol is old name ethylene glycol
now imagine lining these up alternately and making ester with each acid group and each alcohol group losing a molecule of water every time an ester linkage is made
that would produce the chain shown above although this time written without separating out the double bond write it whichever way you like
not describe the way the actual reaction happens it is a way of working out the structure of the polymer
the chemistry of the reaction is more complicated than this
the diagram show a slightly shorter bit of chain than the corresponding one at the top of the page
however it is exactly consistent with the loss of water from the last diagram
it wa impossible to include another in that diagram for space reason
if any of this offends you draw it again yourself so that everything match
in fact it would be good practice to draw a bit of chain starting from a few more monomer
this is what i meant further up the page by working the structure out rather than remembering it
the structure of both monomer are easy to remember
if you line them up and remove water a i have shown the structure follows automatically
hydrolysis of polyester simple ester are easily hydrolysed by reaction with dilute acid or alkali
polyester are attacked readily by alkali but much more slowly by dilute acid
hydrolysis by water alone is so slow a to be completely unimportant
you would expect your polyester fleece to fall to piece if you went out in the rain
if you spill dilute alkali on a fabric made from polyester the ester linkage are broken
is formed together with the salt of the carboxylic acid
because you produce small molecule rather than the original polymer the fibre are destroyed and you end up with a hole
for example if you react the polyester with sodium hydroxide solution manufacturing poly ethylene terephthalate a far a i am aware no exam for year old want this process any longer
if i am wrong you could look at this page from the
you will find variation on the process
if you need to know about this find out what your examiner want and just learn that
