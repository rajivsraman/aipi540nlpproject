dna replication this page take a very simplified look at how dna replicates copy itself
it give only a brief of the process with no attempt to describe the mechanism
a such it is only suitable for 16 18 year old chemistry student
if you are doing biology or biochemistry you are going to need more detail than this page cover
dna
unless you already understand the structure of dna follow this link to read that page first
if you need detailed information about the replication of dna a google search for dna replication will lead you to some well thought out and very clear animation of the process
the best one to start with can be found by following this link
this second link perhaps give a better view of the process but is more difficult to understand if you do look at the other one first
if you are an a level or equivalent chemistry student only look at these if you are interested not because you are likely to need it for exam purpose
both of these link involve flash animation
unfortunately some device such a the ipad do support flash and you wo be able to watch these animation on them
there is no way around that apart from using a standard computer
i am a bit wary of suggesting link to other site because these site can change
if you find that either of these link do work apart from problem with flash please me via the address on the about this site page
replication a very simple look at the process we explain exactly what mean when we have got some diagram to look at
first imagine what happens if the two individual strand in the dna double helix start to unzip
the diagram show this happening in the middle of the dna double helix you must assume that the top of the diagram is the end of the chain
it is
further up the double helix the two strand will still be joined together
in fact this is happening lot of time along the very long dna molecule
length of chain become separated to form what are known a bubble
if you feel the need to see this in more detail read the rest of this page and then have a quick look at the link above
some of the hydrogen bond get broken and the two strand become partly separated
the red dotted line on the diagram just point out the original base pair
these are not bond in any form
these base pair are now much too far apart for any sort of bonding between them
now suppose that you have a source of nucleotide phosphate joined to deoxyribose joined to a base including all the four sort of base needed for dna
the next diagram show what would happen if a nucleotide containing guanine g and one containing cytosine c were attracted to the top two base on the strand of the unzipped dna and then joined together
how did they end up joined together
this is all under the control of a number of enzyme one of which dna polymerase is responsible for joining up nucleotide along the chain in this way
now suppose the same sort of thing happened at the top of the strand
you would end up with
now compare the double strand that you are forming on the and side
they are exactly the same
and if you were to continue this process they would continue to be the same
and if you compare the pattern of base in the new dna being formed with what wa in the original dna before it started to unzip everything is the same
this is inevitable because of the way the base pair together
what doe replication mean
let simplify the last diagram and assume that the whole copying process is complete
the next diagram focusses on the short bit of the total dna molecule that we have been looking at
a typical human dna molecule is around 150 million base pair long you will have to imagine the rest of it
you have also got to remember that in reality the whole thing would have coiled into it double helix
trying to draw that just make everything look messy and complicated
the original dna is shown all in blue
the red strand in the daughter dna are the one which have been built on the original blue strand during the replication process
you can see that each of the daughter molecule is made of half of the original dna plus a new strand
that all replication mean
half of the original dna is conserved kept in each of the daughter molecule
the red and blue of course have no physical significance apart from a a way of making the diagram clearer
all three of these dna molecule will be identical in every way
