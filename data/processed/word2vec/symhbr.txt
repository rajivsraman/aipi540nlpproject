the reaction between symmetrical alkene and the hydrogen halide this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic addition reaction between the hydrogen halide and alkene like ethene and cyclohexene
hydrogen halide include hydrogen chloride and hydrogen bromide
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact alkene react with hydrogen bromide in the cold
the double bond break and a hydrogen atom end up attached to one of the carbon and a bromine atom to the other
in the case of ethene bromoethane is formed
into an ane ending showing that it ha been replaced by
with cyclohexene you get bromocyclohexane
the structure of the cyclohexene and the bromocyclohexane are often simplified each carbon atom ha enough hydrogen attached to make the total number of bond up to 4
in the case of the bromocyclohexane it is necessary to write the new hydrogen into the diagram but it is helpful to put it there to emphasise that addition ha happened
be sure that you understand the relationship between these simplified diagram and the full structure
the mechanism the reaction are example of electrophilic addition
with ethene and hbr and with cyclohexene with ethene and hbr and with cyclohexene the fact hydrogen chloride and the other hydrogen halide add on in exactly the same way
for example hydrogen chloride add to ethene to make chloroethane the only difference is in how fast the reaction happen with the different hydrogen halide
the rate of reaction increase a you go from hf to hcl to hbr to hi
hf slowest reaction hcl hbr hi fastest reaction the reason for this is that a the halogen atom get bigger the strength of the bond fall
bond strength measured in kilojoules per mole are 568 432 366 298 it doe matter the difference are minor and the pattern is always the same
a you have seen in the hbr case in the first step of the mechanism the bond get broken
if the bond is weaker it will break more readily and so the reaction is more likely to happen
the mechanism the reaction are still example of electrophilic addition
with ethene and hcl for example this is exactly the same a the mechanism for the reaction between ethene and hbr except that we replaced br by cl
all the other mechanism for symmetrical alkene and the hydrogen halide would be done in the same way
with ethene and hcl for example this is exactly the same a the mechanism for the reaction between ethene and hbr except that we replaced br by cl
all the other mechanism for symmetrical alkene and the hydrogen halide would be done in the same way
suggestion find out if your syllabus mention a particular hydrogen halide and learn that mechanism
you can simply swap the halogen atom if a different hydrogen halide come up in an exam
have got a syllabus
