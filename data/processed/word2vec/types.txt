halogenoalkanes halogenoalkanes are also called haloalkane or alkyl halide
all halogenoalkanes contain a halogen atom fluorine chlorine bromine or iodine attached to an alkyl group
ch3 or ethyl ch3ch2
these are group containing chain of carbon atom which may be branched
alkyl group are given the general symbol primary halogenoalkanes in a primary halogenoalkane the carbon which carry the halogen atom is only attached to one other alkyl group
some example of primary halogenoalkanes include notice that it doe matter how complicated the attached alkyl group is
in each case there is only one linkage from the ch2 group holding the halogen to an alkyl group
there is an exception to this
ch3br and the other methyl halide are often counted a primary halogenoalkanes even though there are no alkyl group attached to the carbon with the halogen on it
secondary halogenoalkanes in a secondary halogenoalkane the carbon with the halogen attached is joined directly to two other alkyl group which may be the same or different
example tertiary halogenoalkanes in a tertiary halogenoalkane the carbon atom holding the halogen is attached directly to three alkyl group which may be any combination of same or different
