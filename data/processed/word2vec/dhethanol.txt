the dehydration of ethanol this page look at the mechanism for the acid catalysed dehydration of a simple primary alcohol like ethanol to give an alkene like ethene
this is a straightforward a the dehydration of a secondary or tertiary alcohol and it is important that you read the page about the dehydration of before you continue with this page
the fact ethanol can be dehydrated to give ethene by heating it with an excess of concentrated sulphuric acid at about
concentrated phosphoric v acid h3po4 can be used instead
the acid are written into the equation because they serve a catalyst
if you like you could write for example conc h2so4 over the top of the arrow
these are required by any current a level syllabus
the mechanism a problem
you will find two version of the mechanism for the dehydration of primary alcohol on the web and in various textbook
one of these is exactly the same a the mechanism for the reaction involving and other secondary or tertiary alcohol known technically a an e1 mechanism but the other is different known a an e2 mechanism
the more reliable source give the e2 mechanism for the dehydration of primary alcohol including ethanol
i am going to treat this a the correct version and have added a note a to why i think is better following the mechanism
the correct version in full if you have read the page on the dehydration of you will know that it involves the formation of a carbocation a carbonium ion
if ethanol used the same mechanism you would get a primary carbocation formed but this is much less stable than a secondary or tertiary carbocation
that would lead to a very high activation energy for the reaction
the alternative mechanism avoids the formation of the carbocation and so avoids the high activation energy
we are going to discus the mechanism using sulphuric acid
in the first stage one of the lone pair of electron on the oxygen pick up a hydrogen ion from the sulphuric acid
the alcohol is said to be protonated
that is exactly the same a happens with and the other secondary and tertiary alcohol
in the mechanism we have already looked at with the next thing to happen wa loss of water to form a carbocation followed by removal of a hydrogen ion from the carbocation and the formation of a double bond
in this case instead of happening in two separate step this all happens at the same time in one smooth operation
by doing that you avoid the formation of an unstable primary carbocation for primary alcohol
no simplified version of this
i am not giving a simplified version of this mechanism just in term of hydrogen ion
if you do show something removing the hydrogen ion from the protonated alcohol you are really missing an important feature of the reaction
why do i think this is most probably the correct version
there is experimental evidence to support it
while i wa researching this i came across two academic paper here and here
these suggest that there is experimental evidence for both and ethanol dehydrating using a mechanism which doe involve a carbocation a the intermediate
i have been able to find any experimental evidence for a dehydration mechanism involving carbocations in the case of primary alcohol
reliable source quote the mechanism above
for example the first page of a google search for dehydration ethanol mechanism includes two university source from libretexts from the university of california and from the university of calgary
interestingly if you read source giving this mechanism they will usually explain why it is different for primary alcohol rather than secondary or tertiary one in term of the stability of the carbocations
source quoting the other mechanism tend to quote it without comment
i would like to know
any other information giving more evidence for the mechanism above would also be very welcome
please contact me via the address you will find by following this link
the other mechanism that you might come across this is the mechanism that look justs like the one involving and involves the formation of an unstable primary carbocation
this is the version that you would have found on chemguide up to december 2012 and wa originally included because it wa the one wanted by one of the uk exam board aqa at the time i wrote the page in 2000
it is possible that your examiner may still want it
a far a i am aware the only syllabus which i track which still ask this topic are ib and aqa
an old aqa mark scheme gave the version below
ib and aqa student need to read the note that follow
if you need to know about this you need to check what your examiner are currently expecting
note for ib student i contacted ib about this to find out exactly what they wanted and received a prompt and helpful reply essentially they are saying that they expect you to have been taught the correct version of the mechanism the first mechanism on this page but that they will accept either version
i understand that there is no consistency in the version which the various ib textbook give on this either
if you are sure what to do i suggest you talk to your teacher about it
the safest thing to do is to learn the correct version of course and if you intend to carry on with chemistry at a higher level this is what you should do
note for aqa student final update i hope
a very old aqa mark scheme penalised student for giving the correct mechanism by having one mark specifically awarded to showing the structure of an intermediate carbocation in the dehydration of ethanol
if you give the first mechanism above there is no carbocation and so you ca get this mark
i queried this and the current position march 2018 is quoting from aqa response they go on to say i wa teaching this to a class i would want to teach the correct mechanism one for secondary and tertiary alcohol and a different one for primary one
it doe seem to me that teaching this properly add much in the way of difficulty and it avoids the need for student who go on to do chemistry at a higher level having to unlearn an incorrect mechanism
since there is no penalty now in quoting the correct mechanism i think that is what should be taught
we should be in the business of teaching incorrect material
the same thing incidentally applies to the nucleophilic substitution mechanism mentioned in aqa comment
you can not reasonably use the same sn2 mechanism for all kind of halogenoalkane
