the reaction between methylbenzene and chlorine this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the free radical substitution reaction between methylbenzene previously known a toluene and chlorine
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
methylbenzene ha a methyl group attached to a benzene ring
the hexagon with the circle inside is the standard symbol for this ring
there is a carbon atom at each corner of the hexagon and a hydrogen atom on each carbon apart from the one with the methyl group attached
if you are interested you can follow the link but it is important for now
the fact the reaction we are going to explore happens between methylbenzene and chlorine in the presence of ultraviolet light typically sunlight
this is a good example of a photochemical reaction a reaction brought about by light
it is better to use the term photochemical and keep the word catalysis for reaction speeded up by actual substance rather than light
the organic product is chloromethyl benzene
the bracket in the name emphasise that the chlorine is part of the attached methyl group and is on the ring
one of the hydrogen atom in the methyl group ha been replaced by a chlorine atom so this is a substitution reaction
however the reaction doe stop there and all three hydrogen in the methyl group can in turn be replaced by chlorine atom
multiple substitution is dealt with on a separate page and you will find a link to that at the bottom of this page
important
there is another reaction which happens between methylbenzene and chlorine in the absence of light and in the presence of a number of possible catalyst
in that one substitution happens in the benzene ring instead of in the methyl group
you will find this reaction discussed under electrophilic substitution reaction
the mechanism the mechanism involves a chain reaction
during a chain reaction for every reactive specie you start off with a new one is generated at the end and this keep the process going
specie a useful word which is used in chemistry to mean any sort of particle you want it to mean
it cover molecule ion atom or in this case free radical
the process is known a free radical substitution or a a free radical chain reaction
what is free radical substitution

chain initiation the chain is initiated started by uv light breaking a chlorine molecule into free radical
chain propagation reaction these are the reaction which keep the chain going
chain termination reaction these are reaction which remove free radical from the system without replacing them by new one
if any two free radical collide they will join together without producing any new radical
the simplest example of this is a collision between two chlorine radical
