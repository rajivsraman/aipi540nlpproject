assorted reaction of phenol this page give detail of some reaction of phenol not covered elsewhere in this section
it deal with the combustion and esterification of phenol and the use of iron iii chloride solution ferric chloride solution a a test for phenol
combustion of phenol phenol burn in a plentiful supply of oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water
however for compound containing benzene ring combustion is hardly ever complete especially if they are burnt in air
the high proportion of carbon in phenol mean that you need a very high proportion of oxygen to phenol to get complete combustion
look at the equation
a a general rule the hydrogen in a molecule tends to get what oxygen is available first leaving the carbon to form carbon itself or carbon monoxide if there is enough oxygen to go round
phenol tends to burn in air with an extremely smoky flame full of carbon particle
esterification of phenol you will probably remember that you can make ester from alcohol by reacting them with carboxylic acid
you might expect phenol to be similar
there is much more detail on that page
if you choose to follow this link on your browser if you want to return to this page later
however unlike alcohol phenol reacts so slowly with carboxylic acid that you normally react it with acyl chloride acid chloride or acid anhydride instead
making ester from phenol using an acyl chloride a typical acyl chloride is ethanoyl chloride ch3cocl
phenol reacts with ethanoyl chloride at room temperature although the reaction is a fast a the one between ethanoyl chloride and an alcohol
phenyl ethanoate is formed together with hydrogen chloride gas
sometimes it is necessary to modify the phenol first to make the reaction faster
for example benzoyl chloride ha the formula c6h5cocl
the group is attached directly to a benzene ring
it is much less reactive than simple acyl chloride like ethanoyl chloride
in order to get a reasonably quick reaction with benzoyl chloride the phenol is first converted into sodium phenoxide by dissolving it in sodium hydroxide solution
the phenoxide ion reacts more rapidly with benzoyl chloride than the original phenol doe but even so you have to shake it with benzoyl chloride for about 15 minute
solid phenyl benzoate is formed
making ester from phenol using an acid anhydride a typical acid anhydride is ethanoic anhydride ch3co 2o
the reaction of acid anhydride are slower than the corresponding reaction with acyl chloride and you usually need to warm the mixture
again you can react the phenol with sodium hydroxide solution first producing the more reactive phenoxide ion
if you simply use phenol and ethanoic anhydride phenyl ethanoate is formed together with ethanoic acid
this reaction is important itself but a very similar reaction is involved in the manufacture of aspirin covered in detail on another page link below
if the phenol is first converted into sodium phenoxide by adding sodium hydroxide solution the reaction is faster
phenyl ethanoate is again formed but this time the other product is sodium ethanoate rather than ethanoic acid
the reaction with iron iii chloride solution iron iii chloride is sometimes known a ferric chloride
iron iii ion form strongly coloured complex with several organic compound including phenol
the colour of the complex vary from compound to compound
the reaction with iron iii chloride solution can be used a a test for phenol
if you add a crystal of phenol to iron iii chloride solution you get an intense solution formed
dilute ammonia solution is added dropwise to iron iii chloride solution to give a faint precipitate of iron iii hydroxide
then that precipitate is removed by adding a small amount of the original iron iii chloride solution
