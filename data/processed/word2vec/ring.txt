ring reaction of phenol this page look at the way the reaction of the benzene ring in phenol are modified by the presence of the attached group
it cover the reaction of phenol with bromine water and with nitric acid
how doe the group modify the ring reaction
activation of the ring the group attached to the benzene ring in phenol ha the effect of making the ring much more reactive than it would otherwise be
for example a you will find below phenol will react with a solution of bromine in water bromine water in the cold and in the absence of any catalyst
it also reacts with dilute nitric acid whereas benzene itself need a nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric acid and concentrated sulphuric acid
you need to understand about the bonding in benzene in order to make sense of this next bit

one of the lone pair on the oxygen atom in the group overlap with the delocalised ring electron system
giving a structure rather like this the donation of the oxygen lone pair into the ring system increase the electron density around the ring
a benzene ring undergoes substitution reaction in which the ring electron are attacked by positive ion or the slightly positive part of molecule
in other word it undergoes electrophilic substitution
if you increase the electron density around the ring it becomes even more attractive to incoming electrophiles
that what happens in phenol

the directing effect of the group the group ha more activating effect on some position around the ring than others for reason which go beyond uk a level
that mean that incoming group will go into some position much faster than they will into others
the net effect of this is that the group ha a effect
that mean that incoming group will tend to go into the position next door to the group or the position opposite the group
you will get hardly any of the isomer formed it is produced too slowly
specific example reaction with bromine water if bromine water is added to a solution of phenol in water the bromine water is decolourised and a white precipitate is formed which smell of antiseptic
the precipitate is
notice the multiple substitution around the ring into all the activated position
the position is of course just the same a the position
both are next door to the group
double bond
the important difference with phenol is the formation of a white precipitate a well a the bromine water being decolourised

reaction with nitric acid the reaction with nitric acid are complicated because nitric acid is an oxidising agent and phenol is very easily oxidised to give complex tarry product
what follows miss all that complication out and just concentrate on the ring substitution which happens a well
with dilute nitric acid phenol reacts with dilute nitric acid at room temperature to give a mixture of and
with concentrated nitric acid with concentrated nitric acid more nitro group substitute around the ring to give old name picric acid
