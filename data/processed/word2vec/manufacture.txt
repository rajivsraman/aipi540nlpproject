manufacturing arenes this page look at the manufacture of arenes such a benzene and methylbenzene toluene by the catalytic reforming of fraction from petroleum crude oil
catalytic reforming what is reforming
reforming take straight chain hydrocarbon in the c6 to c8 range from the gasoline or naphtha fraction and rearranges them into compound containing benzene ring
hydrogen is produced a a of the reaction
for example hexane c6h14 loses hydrogen and turn into benzene
a long a you draw the hexane bent into a circle it is easy to see what is happening
similarly methylbenzene toluene is made from heptane the process the feedstock the feedstock is a mixture of the naphtha or gasoline fraction and hydrogen
the hydrogen is there to help prevent the formation of carbon by decomposition of the hydrocarbon at the high temperature used
the carbon would otherwise contaminate the catalyst
the catalyst a typical catalyst is a mixture of platinum and aluminium oxide
with a platinum catalyst the process is sometimes described a platforming
temperature and pressure the temperature is about and the pressure varies either side of 20 atmosphere
converting some of the methylbenzene into benzene methylbenzene is much less commercially valuable than benzene
the methyl group can be removed from the ring by a process known a dealkylation
the methylbenzene is mixed with hydrogen at a temperature of between 550 and and a pressure of between 30 and 50 atmosphere with a mixture of silicon dioxide and aluminium oxide a catalyst
