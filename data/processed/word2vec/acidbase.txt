the behaviour of amino acid this page look at what happens to amino acid a you change the ph by adding either acid or alkali to their solution
for simplicity the page only look at amino acid which contain a single group and a single group
amino acid a zwitterions zwitterions in simple amino acid solution an amino acid ha both a basic amine group and an acidic carboxylic acid group
there is an internal transfer of a hydrogen ion from the group to the group to leave an ion with both a negative charge and a positive charge
this is called a zwitterion
this is the form that amino acid exist in even in the solid state
if you dissolve the amino acid in water a simple solution also contains this ion
a zwitterion is a compound with no overall electrical charge but which contains separate part which are positively and negatively charged
adding an alkali to an amino acid solution if you increase the ph of a solution of an amino acid by adding hydroxide ion the hydrogen ion is removed from the group
you could show that the amino acid now existed a a negative ion using electrophoresis
in it simplest form electrophoresis can just consist of a piece of moistened filter paper on a microscope slide with a crocodile clip at each end attached to a battery
a drop of amino acid solution is placed in the centre of the paper
although the amino acid solution is colourless it position after a time can be found by spraying it with a solution of ninhydrin
if the paper is allowed to dry and then heated gently the amino acid show up a a coloured spot
the amino acid would be found to travel towards the anode the positive electrode
adding an acid to an amino acid solution if you decrease the ph by adding an acid to a solution of an amino acid the part of the zwitterion pick up a hydrogen ion
this time during electrophoresis the amino acid would move towards the cathode the negative electrode
shifting the ph from one extreme to the other suppose you start with the ion we just produced under acidic condition and slowly add alkali to it
that ion contains two acidic hydrogen the one in the group and the one in the group
the more acidic of these is the one in the group and so that is removed first and you get back to the zwitterion
so when you have added just the right amount of alkali the amino acid no longer ha a net positive or negative charge
that mean that it would move towards either the cathode or anode during electrophoresis
the ph at which this lack of movement during electrophoresis happens is known a the isoelectric point of the amino acid
this ph varies from amino acid to amino acid
if you go on adding hydroxide ion you will get the reaction we already seen in which a hydrogen ion is removed from the group
in fact the isoelectric point for many amino acid is about ph 6
explaining why it is at ph 7 is quite and almost certainly beyond what you will need for uk a level or it equivalent purpose
if you are interested the problem is discussed at the bottom of this page
you can of course reverse the whole process by adding an acid to the ion we just finished up with
that ion contains two basic group the group and the group
the group is the stronger base and so pick up hydrogen ion first
that lead you back to the zwitterion again
and of course you can keep going by then adding a hydrogen ion to the group
why is the isoelectric point of an amino acid at ph 7
warning if you are a studying a syllabus you are extremely unlikely to need this for exam purpose
it is included only for interest you can probably safely ignore it
check your syllabus and past paper

when an amino acid dissolve in water the situation is a little bit more complicated than we tend to pretend at this level
the zwitterion interacts with water molecule acting a both an acid and a base
a an acid the group is a weak acid and donates a hydrogen ion to a water molecule
because it is only a weak acid the position of equilibrium will lie to the left
a a base the group is a weak base and take a hydrogen ion from a water molecule
again the equilibrium lie to the left
when you dissolve an amino acid in water both of these reaction are happening
but
the position of the two equilibrium are identical they vary depending on the influence of the r group
in practice for the simple amino acid we have been talking about the position of the first equilibrium lie a bit further to the right than the second one
that mean that there will be rather more of the negative ion from the amino acid in the solution than the positive one
in those circumstance if you carried out electrophoresis on the unmodified solution there would be a slight drift of amino acid towards the positive electrode the anode
to stop that you need to cut down the amount of the negative ion so that the concentration of the two ion are identical
you can do that by adding a very small amount of acid to the solution moving the position of the first equilibrium further to the left
typically the ph ha to be lowered to about 6 to achieve this
for glycine for example the isoelectric point is ph for alanine and for serine
the isoelectric point are quite different if the molecule contains a second or group
