the acidity of organic acid this page explains the acidity of simple organic acid and look at the factor which affect their relative strength
why are organic acid acidic
organic acid a weak acid for the purpose of this topic we are going to take the definition of an acid a a substance which donates hydrogen ion proton to other thing
we are going to get a measure of this by looking at how easily the acid release hydrogen ion to water molecule when they are in solution in water
an acid in solution set up this equilibrium ah rather than ha because in all the case we shall be looking at the hydrogen we are interested in is at the end of a molecule
a hydroxonium ion is formed together with the anion negative ion from the acid
this equilibrium is sometimes simplified by leaving out the water to emphasise the ionisation of the acid
if you write it like this you must include the state symbol aq
writing aq implies that the hydrogen ion is attached to a water molecule a
hydrogen ion are always attached to something during chemical reaction
the organic acid are weak in the sense that this ionisation is very incomplete
at any one time most of the acid will be present in the solution a molecule
for example in the case of dilute ethanoic acid the solution contains about 99 of ethanoic acid molecule at any instant only about 1 have actually ionised
the position of equilibrium therefore lie well to the left
comparing the strength of weak acid the strength of weak acid are measured on the pka scale
the smaller the number on this scale the stronger the acid is
three of the compound we shall be looking at together with their pka value are remember the smaller the number the stronger the acid
comparing the other two to ethanoic acid you will see that phenol is very much weaker with a pka of and ethanol is so weak with a pka of about 16 that it hardly count a acidic at all
why are these acid acidic
in each case the same bond get broken the bond between the hydrogen and oxygen in an group
writing the rest of the molecule a x it is however particularly important to the rest of the current page

so
if the same bond is being broken in each case why do these three compound have such widely different acid strength
difference in acid strength between carboxylic acid phenol and alcohol the factor to consider two of the factor which influence the ionisation of an acid are the strength of the bond being broken the stability of the ion being formed
in these case you seem to be breaking the same bond each time and so you might expect the strength to be similar
the bond wo be identically strong because what around them in the molecule is the same in each case
the most important factor in determining the relative acid strength of these molecule is the nature of the ion formed
you always get a hydroxonium ion so that constant but the nature of the anion the negative ion varies markedly from case to case
ethanoic acid ethanoic acid ha the structure the acidic hydrogen is the one attached to the oxygen
when ethanoic acid ionises it form the ethanoate ion
you might reasonably suppose that the structure of the ethanoate ion wa a below but measurement of bond length show that the two bond are identical and somewhere in length between a single and a double bond
to understand why this is you have to look in some detail at the bonding in the ethanoate ion

if you do already understand about the bonding in the double bond you would be well advised to skip this next bit all the way down to the simplified structure of the ethanoate ion towards the end of it

like any other double bond a double bond is made up of two different part
one electron pair is found on the line between the two nucleus this is known a a sigma bond
the other electron pair is found above and below the plane of the molecule in a pi bond
pi bond are made by sideways overlap between p orbitals on the carbon and the oxygen
in an ethanoate ion one of the lone pair on the negative oxygen end up almost parallel to these p orbitals and overlap with them
this lead to a delocalised pi system over the whole of the group rather like that in benzene
all the oxygen lone pair have been left out of this diagram to avoid confusion
because the oxygen are more electronegative than the carbon the delocalised system is heavily distorted so that the electron spend much more time in the region of the oxygen atom
so where is the negative charge in all this
it ha been spread around over the whole of the group but with the greatest chance of finding it in the region of the two oxygen atom
ethanoate ion can be drawn simply a the dotted line represents the delocalisation
the negative charge is written centrally on that end of the molecule to show that it is localised on one of the oxygen atom
the more you can spread charge around the more stable an ion becomes
in this case if you delocalise the negative charge over several atom it is going to be much less attractive to hydrogen ion and so you are less likely to the ethanoic acid
phenol phenol have an group attached directly to a benzene ring
phenol itself is the simplest of these with nothing else attached to the ring apart from the group
when the bond in phenol break you get a phenoxide ion
you need to understand about the bonding in benzene in order to make sense of this next bit
if your syllabus say that you need to know about the acidity of phenol then you will have to understand the next few paragraph which in turn mean that you will have to understand about benzene
if it doe mention phenol skip it

delocalisation also occurs in this ion
this time one of the lone pair on the oxygen atom overlap with the delocalised electron on the benzene ring
this overlap lead to a delocalisation which extends from the ring out over the oxygen atom
a a result the negative charge is no longer entirely localised on the oxygen but is spread out around the whole ion
why then is phenol a much weaker acid than ethanoic acid
think about the ethanoate ion again
if there wa any delocalisation the charge would all be on one of the oxygen atom like this but the delocalisation spread this charge over the whole of the coo group
because oxygen is more electronegative than carbon you can think of most of the charge being shared between the two oxygen shown by the heavy red shading in this diagram
if there wa any delocalisation one of the oxygen would have a full charge which would be very attractive towards hydrogen ion
with delocalisation that charge is spread over two oxygen atom and neither will be a attractive to a hydrogen ion a if one of the oxygen carried the whole charge
that mean that the ethanoate ion wo take up a hydrogen ion a easily a it would if there wa any delocalisation
because some of it stay ionised the formation of the hydrogen ion mean that it is acidic
in the phenoxide ion the single oxygen atom is still the most electronegative thing present and the delocalised system will be heavily distorted towards it
that still leaf the oxygen atom with most of it negative charge
what delocalisation there is make the phenoxide ion more stable than it would otherwise be and so phenol is acidic to an extent
however the delocalisation ha shared the charge around very effectively
there is still lot of negative charge around the oxygen to which hydrogen ion will be attracted and so the phenol will readily
phenol is therefore only very weakly acidic
ethanol ethanol ch3ch2oh is so weakly acidic that you would hardly count it a acidic at all
if the bond break to release a hydrogen ion an ethoxide ion is formed this ha nothing at all going for it
there is no way of delocalising the negative charge which remains firmly on the oxygen atom
that intense negative charge will be highly attractive towards hydrogen ion and so the ethanol will instantly
since ethanol is very poor at losing hydrogen ion it is hardly acidic at all
variation in acid strength between different carboxylic acid you might think that all carboxylic acid would have the same strength because each depends on the delocalisation of the negative charge around the group to make the anion more stable and so more reluctant to with a hydrogen ion
in fact the carboxylic acid have widely different acidity
one obvious difference is between methanoic acid hcooh and the other simple carboxylic acid remember that the higher the value for pka the weaker the acid is
why is ethanoic acid weaker than methanoic acid
it again depends on the stability of the anion formed on how much it is possible to delocalise the negative charge
the less the charge is delocalised the less stable the ion and the weaker the acid
the methanoate ion from methanoic acid is the only difference between this and the ethanoate ion is the presence of the ch3 group in the ethanoate
but that important
alkyl group have a tendency to push electron away from themselves
that mean that there will be a small amount of extra negative charge built up on the group
any of charge will make the ion less stable and more attractive to hydrogen ion
ethanoic acid is therefore weaker than methanoic acid because it will more easily from it ion
the other alkyl group have effect very similar to the methyl group and so the strength of propanoic acid and butanoic acid are very similar to ethanoic acid
the acid can be strengthened by pulling charge away from the end
you can do this by attaching electronegative atom like chlorine to the chain
a the next table show the more chlorine you can attach the better trichloroethanoic acid is quite a strong acid
attaching different halogen also make a difference
fluorine is the most electronegative and so you would expect it to be most successful at pulling charge away from the end and so strengthening the acid
the effect is there but is a great a you might expect
finally notice that the effect fall off quite quickly a the attached halogen get further away from the end
here is what happens if you move a chlorine atom along the chain in butanoic acid
the chlorine is effective at withdrawing charge when it is to the group and much less so a it get even one carbon further away
