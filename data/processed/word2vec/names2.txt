the name of more organic compound this page continues looking at the name of organic compound containing chain of carbon atom
it assumes that you have already looked at the introductory page covering compound from alkane to ketone
the name on this second page are explained in quite a much detail a those on the introductory page it assumes that you have already understood the main principle
if in doubt follow this link first
more type of organic compound carboxylic acid carboxylic acid contain the group which is better written out in full a carboxylic acid are shown by the ending oic acid
when you count the carbon chain you have to remember to include the carbon in the group
that carbon is always thought of a number 1 in the chain
example 1 write the structural formula for acid
this is a four carbon acid with no double bond
there is a methyl group on the third carbon counting the carbon a number 1
example 2 write the structural formula for acid
the hydroxy part of the name show the presence of an group
normally you would show that by the ending ol but this time you ca because you already got another ending
you are forced into this alternative way of describing it
the old name for acid is lactic acid
that name sound more friendly but is utterly useless when it come to writing a formula for it
in the old day you would have had to learn the formula rather than just working it out should you need it
example 3 write the structural formula for acid
this time not only is there a chlorine attached to the chain but the chain also contains a double bond en starting on the number 3 carbon counting the carbon a number 1
salt of carboxylic acid example write the structural formula for sodium propanoate
this is the sodium salt of propanoic acid so start from that
propanoic acid is a three carbon acid with no double bond
when the carboxylic acid form salt the hydrogen in the group is replaced by a metal
sodium propanoate is therefore notice that there is an ionic bond between the sodium and the propanoate group
whatever you do do draw a line between the sodium and the oxygen
that would represent a covalent bond
it wrong and make you look very incompetent in an exam
in a shortened version sodium propanoate would be written ch3ch2coona or if you wanted to emphasise the ionic nature a
in the formula the sodium is at the end but appears first in the name
why
salt are always named with the metal first think of sodium chloride or potassium iodide
so for consistency you would need to reverse the formula of sodium propanoate naoocch2ch3
but if you reverse the formula you ca see immediately that it is related to propanoic acid
so you learn to live with the inconsistency
ester ester are one of a number of compound known collectively a acid derivative
in these the acid group is modified in some way
in an ester the hydrogen in the group is replaced by an alkyl group or possibly some more complex hydrocarbon group
example 1 write the structural formula for methyl propanoate
an ester name ha two part the part that come from the acid propanoate and the part that show the alkyl group methyl
start by thinking about propanoic acid a 3 carbon acid with no double bond
the hydrogen in the group is replaced by an alkyl group in this case a methyl group
ester name are confusing because the name is written backwards from the way the structure is drawn
there no way round this you just have to get used to it
in the shortened version this formula would be written ch3ch2cooch3
example 2 write the structural formula for ethyl ethanoate
this is probably the most commonly used example of an ester
it is based on ethanoic acid hence ethanoate a 2 carbon acid
the hydrogen in the group is replaced by an ethyl group
make sure that you draw the ethyl group the right way round
a fairly common mistake is to try to join the ch3 group to the oxygen
if you count the bond if you do that you will find that both the ch3 carbon and the ch2 carbon have the wrong number of bond
acyl chloride acid chloride an acyl chloride is another acid derivative
in this case the group of the acid is replaced by
all acyl chloride contain the group example write the structural formula for ethanoyl chloride
acyl chloride are shown by the ending oyl chloride
so ethanoyl chloride is based on a 2 carbon chain with no double bond and a group
the carbon in that group count a part of the chain
in a longer chain with side group attached the carbon is given the number 1 position
acid anhydride another acid derivative
an acid anhydride is what you get if you dehydrate an acid that is remove water from it
example write the structural formula for propanoic anhydride
these are most easily worked out by writing it down on a scrap of paper in the following way draw two molecule of acid arranged so that the group are next to each other
tweak out a molecule of water and then join up what left
in this case because you want propanoic anhydride you draw two molecule of propanoic acid
amide yet another acid derivative
amide contain the group where the of an acid is replaced by
example write the structural formula for propanamide
this is based on a 3 carbon chain with no double bond
at the end of the chain is a group
the carbon in that group count a part of the chain
nitrile nitrile contain a group and used to be called cyanide
example 1 write the structural formula for ethanenitrile
the name show a 2 carbon chain with no double bond
nitrile show a group at the end of the chain
a with the previous example involving acid and acid derivative do forget that the carbon in the group count a part of the chain
the old name for this would have been methyl cyanide
you might think that that easier but a soon a the chain get more complicated it doe work a the next example show
example 2 write the structural formula for
here we got a 3 carbon chain no double bond and a group on the end of the chain
the carbon in the group count a the number 1 carbon
on the number 2 carbon there is an group hydroxy
notice that you ca use the ol ending because you already got a nitrile ending
primary amine a primary amine contains the group attached to a hydrocarbon chain or ring
you can think of amine in general a being derived from ammonia nh3
in a primary amine one of the hydrogen ha been replaced by a hydrocarbon group
example 1 write the structural formula for ethylamine
in this case an ethyl group is attached to the group
this name ethylamine is fine a long a you only got a short chain where there is any ambiguity about where the group is found
but suppose you had a 3 carbon chain in this case the group could be on an end carbon or on the middle carbon
how you get around that problem is illustrated in the next example
example 2 write the structural formula for
the name show a 3 carbon chain with an amino group attached to the second carbon
amino show the group
ethylamine example 1 above could equally well have been called aminoethane
secondary and tertiary amine you are only likely to come across simple example of these
in a secondary amine two of the hydrogen atom in an ammonia molecule have been replaced by hydrocarbon group
in a tertiary amine all three hydrogen have been replaced
example 1 write the structural formula for dimethylamine
in this case two of the hydrogen in ammonia have been replaced by methyl group
example 2 write the structural formula for trimethylamine
here all three hydrogen in ammonia have been replaced by methyl group
amino acid an amino acid contains both an amino group and a carboxylic acid group in the same molecule
a with all acid the carbon chain is numbered so that the carbon in the group is counted a number 1
example write the structural formula for acid
this ha a 3 carbon chain with no double bond
on the second carbon counting the carbon a number 1 there is an amino group
