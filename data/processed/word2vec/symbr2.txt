the reaction between symmetrical alkene and bromine this page give you the fact and a simple uncluttered mechanism for the electrophilic addition reaction between bromine and the other halogen and alkene like ethene and cyclohexene
if you want the mechanism explained to you in detail there is a link at the bottom of the page
the fact alkene react in the cold with pure liquid bromine or with a solution of bromine in an organic solvent like tetrachloromethane
the double bond break and a bromine atom becomes attached to each carbon
the bromine loses it original colour to give a colourless liquid
in the case of the reaction with ethene is formed
this decolourisation of bromine is often used a a test for a double bond
if an aqueous solution of bromine is used bromine water you get a mixture of product
the presence of the water complicates the mechanism beyond what is required by current uk a level or equivalent syllabus
the other halogen apart from fluorine behave similarly
fluorine reacts explosively with all hydrocarbon including alkene to give carbon and hydrogen fluoride
if you are interested in the reaction with say chlorine all you have to do is to replace br by cl in all the equation on this page
the mechanism for the reaction between ethene and bromine the reaction is an example of electrophilic addition
there are two version of the ethene bromine mechanism in common use and you must know which your examiner will accept
one version is simplified to bring it into line with the other alkene electrophilic addition mechanism
you will probably find that your examiner will accept this one but you must find out to be sure
you almost certainly wo be able to tell this from your syllabus
you need to refer to recent mark scheme or to any support material that your examiner provide
if you still are sure contact your examiner direct
if you are working towards a exam you can find out how to do this by using the link to your board web site on the syllabus page
the person you need to contact will probably have the title subject officer for chemistry or something similar
ask whether they want the mechanism for the reaction between bromine and alkene which proceeds via a carbocation or via a bromonium ion intermediate
bromine a an electrophile the bromine is a very polarisable molecule and the approaching pi bond in the ethene induces a dipole in the bromine molecule
if you draw this mechanism in an exam write the word induced dipole next to the bromine molecule to show that you understand what going on
the simplified version of the mechanism the more accurate version of the mechanism there is a real risk of getting confused
if your examiner are happy to accept the simple version there no point in making life difficult for yourself
in the first stage of the reaction one of the bromine atom becomes attached to both carbon atom with the positive charge being found on the bromine atom
a bromonium ion is formed
the bromonium ion is then attacked from the back by a bromide ion formed in a nearby reaction
the fact cyclohexene reacts with bromine in the same way and under the same condition a any other alkene
is formed
the mechanism for the reaction between cyclohexene and bromine the reaction is an example of electrophilic addition
again there are two version of this mechanism in common use and you must know which your examiner will accept
bromine a an electrophile again the bromine is polarised by the approaching pi bond in the cyclohexene
do forget to write the word induced dipole next to the bromine molecule
the simplified version of the mechanism the alternative version of the mechanism if your examiner are happy to accept the simple version there no point in making life difficult for yourself
in the first stage of the reaction one of the bromine atom becomes attached to both carbon atom with the positive charge being found on the bromine atom
a bromonium ion is formed
the bromonium ion is then attacked from the back by a bromide ion formed in a nearby reaction
