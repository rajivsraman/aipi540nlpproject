the acidity of phenol this page explains why phenol is a weak acid and look at it reaction or in some case lack of reaction with base and with sodium metal
why is phenol acidic
compound like alcohol and phenol which contain an group attached to a hydrocarbon are very weak acid
alcohol are so weakly acidic that for normal lab purpose their acidity can be virtually ignored
however phenol is sufficiently acidic for it to have recognisably acidic property even if it is still a very weak acid
a hydrogen ion can break away from the group and transfer to a base
for example in solution in water phenol is a very weak acid and the position of equilibrium lie well to the left
phenol can lose a hydrogen ion because the phenoxide ion formed is stabilised to some extent
the negative charge on the oxygen atom is delocalised around the ring
the more stable the ion is the more likely it is to form
one of the lone pair on the oxygen atom overlap with the delocalised electron on the benzene ring
this overlap lead to a delocalisation which extends from the ring out over the oxygen atom
a a result the negative charge is no longer entirely localised on the oxygen but is spread out around the whole ion
spreading the charge around make the ion more stable than it would be if all the charge remained on the oxygen
however
oxygen is the most electronegative element in the ion and the delocalised electron will be drawn towards it
that mean that there will still be a lot of charge around the oxygen which will tend to attract the hydrogen ion back again
that why phenol is only a very weak acid

property of phenol a an acid with indicator the ph of a typical dilute solution of phenol in water is likely to be around 5 6 depending on it concentration
that mean that a very dilute solution is really acidic enough to turn litmus paper fully red
litmus paper is blue at ph 8 and red at ph 5
anything in between is going to show a some shade of neutral
with sodium hydroxide solution phenol reacts with sodium hydroxide solution to give a colourless solution containing sodium phenoxide
in this reaction the hydrogen ion ha been removed by the strongly basic hydroxide ion in the sodium hydroxide solution
with sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogencarbonate unlike the majority of acid phenol doe give carbon dioxide when you mix it with sodium carbonate or sodium hydrogencarbonate solution
it is acidic enough
in the first step a carbonate ion pick up a hydrogen ion to give a hydrogencarbonate ion
in the second step a hydrogencarbonate ion pick up another hydrogen ion to give carbon dioxide and water
phenol is acidic enough to do the first step and so convert carbonate ion into hydrogencarbonate ion but is acidic enough to do the second step
so sodium carbonate reacts partially with phenol to produce a solution containing sodium phenoxide and sodium hydrogencarbonate but doe go any further
and of course it wo react with sodium hydrogencarbonate itself
this lack of any carbon dioxide being formed is actually useful
you can recognise phenol because it is fairly insoluble in water
it reacts with sodium hydroxide solution to give a colourless solution and therefore must be acidic
it doe produce carbon dioxide with sodium carbonate or hydrogencarbonate solution and so must be only very weakly acidic
with metallic sodium acid react with the more reactive metal to give hydrogen gas
phenol is no exception the only difference is the slow reaction because phenol is such a weak acid
phenol is warmed in a dry tube until it is molten and a small piece of sodium added
there is some fizzing a hydrogen gas is given off
the mixture left in the tube will contain sodium phenoxide
under no circumstance should you try this without professional supervision and good access to medical help
the risk involved in careless handling of the hot phenol and sodium are too great
